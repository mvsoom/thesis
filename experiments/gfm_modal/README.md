# gfm_model

We redo the relaxation_centered experiment, but

- With LF modalities used in OPENGLOT-I (4 in total)
- With the full LF modal so the closed phase is "baked in"
- Use period of 7 msec (= geometric mean for pitch ranges of adults)

## Prelim results

Looks good, tack kernels win for all modalities

- Normalized kernels are typically better than unnormalized, but much higher information and very large sigma_a => same as in relaxation_centered experiment
