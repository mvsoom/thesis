Clustering works when Q >= 3
See ./eggs

First time seeing consistent clustering => Fourier approach works for all Q >= 3

- Works for all K
- K = 3 seems sweet spot
- probably find to set Q=3,4 or so

Increasing M increases sharpness strongly

Lengthscale all = 0.08 (weirdly) and small sqrt(variance) = 0.25

Way too much Adam iterations, can save there
