# svi/aplawd_vff

Just a quick check if t-PRISM-VFF works

Answer: it does, but t-PRISM with inducing points in the time domain is much more effective (ie, svi/aplawd experiment)

Just isn't the right tool for the job as harmonic domain is not a good descriptor for pitch tracks

Also needs more adam iterations than svi/aplawd

General results:
  - obs_stddev: ~0.25
  - lengthscales > 20, around 35-40
