<chapter:conclusion>

Possible improvements/future directions:
- $p(a)$ not as a delta function in IKLP
- work in spectral domain completely
- model $h(t)$ as a GP conditional on $e(t)$ given: alternate optimization
- interframe correlations as in @Mehta2012

/*
applications of a reliable white-box speech model:

speech and language sciences:
phonetics: articulatoryâ€“acoustic mapping and voice quality analysis
phonology: experimental study of speech sound systems
linguistics: prosody and phonological patterning

biomedical and clinical:
speech-language pathology: assessment and therapy of voice and motor speech disorders
laryngology: diagnosis and surgical planning for vocal fold disorders
neurology: biomarkers for neurodegenerative or motor control diseases
respiratory medicine: coupling between respiration and phonation
otolaryngology: quantitative evaluation of vocal performance and hearing

forensic and security:
forensic phonetics: speaker identification and authenticity testing
biometric security: voice-based identification and verification

engineering and technology:
speech technology: synthesis, coding, and generative speech models
robotics: natural voice generation and auditory feedback

comparative biology and evolution:
bioacoustics: modeling vocal production in animals
evolutionary linguistics: comparative study of vocal systems across species

Glottal characterization has also been shown to be helpful in another
biomedical problem: the classification of clinical depression in speech. In
(Ozdas et al. (2004))
