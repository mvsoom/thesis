The periodic arc cosine kernel (PACK)

/*
Our sampling of freqs in the Nyquist band reproduces the Sinc kernel-property that we automatically band limit the smoothness => good prior information

Nyquist reconstruction essentially expresses that by bandlimiting frequency information we limit smoothness, thereby making perfect reconstruction possible in principle.

Multiplying with SqExp with low order Hilbert amplitude envelope doesn't add high freq information, neither does summing with slowly varying DC background, so principle is still preserved. However, white noise delta reintroduces full spectrum!

Matern kernels and others do not take into account Nyquist information, whereas RFF (random fourier features) / SM (spectral mixture) kernels do.
