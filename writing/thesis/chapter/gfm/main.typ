= From parametric to nonparametric glottal flow models
<chapter:gfm>

Glottal flow models (GFMs) describe the source signal $u(t)$ as it drives the vocal tract during voiced speech.
These models operate in the time domain because the delicate phase characteristics of the _glottal cycle_ are an integral part of vocal communication.#footnote[
  For example, plosives: glottal stops are micro-events at the millisecond level that underlie semantic information two orders of magnitude higher up the scale.
  The timing of the vocal fold movement is so precisely controlled by our brain that the slightest deviations are studied as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's @Ma2020.
]
// "timing relationships are very important for modelling the glottal flow signal" @Doval2006

Decades of empirical work have over time produced a "model zoo" of GFMs: handcrafted waveforms of $u(t)$ with handfuls of carefully chosen parameters.
Because these are _parametric_ models, they all share the same basic traits: parsimonious, interpretable, but inevitably stiff @Schleusing2012. Their parametric nature limits the range of time domain information they can encode.
This motivates the construction of a family of _nonparametric_ models, which reach for greater expressivity with _less_ parameters.

With the many equations to follow, it is all too easy to lose connection to the actual physical phenomenon being modeled.
After a short look at the glottal cycle, we begin with a review of the classic Liljencrants-Fant model.
Then we revisit the parametric piecewise polynomial models and generalize them to the nonparametric regime, where they are identified with the _arc cosine kernel_ of #pcite(<Cho2009>).
The latter is argued to combine the advantages of both worlds: the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric ones.
This then sets the stage for @chapter:pack, which derives the _periodic arc cosine kernel_ as a learnable surrogate model of synthetic glottal flow data.

) <fig:glottal-cycle>
 
==== The glottal cycle
is the periodic opening and closing of the vocal folds, depicted in @fig:glottal-cycle.
During one _pitch period_, a single cycle is completed, in this case spanning $T = "6 ms"$.
GFMs describe the rate of airflow $u(t)$ [typically expressed in cmÂ³/s] through the opening between the vocal folds called the _glottis_, visible as a black slit in @fig:glottal-cycle.
Importantly, it is not at maximum glottis aperture that the acoustic output is greatest; it is at the sudden _glottal closure instant_ (GCI), as first shown by #pcite(<Miller1959>) in modern literature.
At this point, the moving air column in the vocal tract is abruptly interrupted, and kinetic energy is converted efficiently into acoustic energy which then excites the vocal tract much like plucking a harp or clapping in a resonant room @Chen2016[Section~4.6].
The sharpness of this transition governs much of the clarity and perceived strength of voiced speech @Fant1979.
Thus, efficiency demands that the glottal cycle be strongly asymmetric: a slow buildup of flow during the open phase, followed by a rapid, almost impulsive closure to the closed phase.

== The Liljencrants-Fant model

A model that has been very useful in describing how $u(t)$ varies during the glottal cycle is the _Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model_ proposed by #pcite(<Fant1985>).
It has been the GFM of choice for many joint-inverse filtering approaches#footnote[
  See #section-title-page(<sec:joint-source-filter-methods>).
] but also been studied in its own right.#footnote[
  See #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [Section~2.4]) for a discussion. Research into the LF model falls mainly into study of its spectral characteristics @Doval2006 and (re)parametrization, notably #pcite(<Fant1995>) #pcite(<Perrotin2021>).
]

The model states that $u'(t)$ in a single pitch period of length $T$ consists of three parts, or phases. The _open phase_ (O) is modeled as a rising and falling exponential sinusoid part, and transitions to the _closed phase_ (C) via an exponential return during the _return phase_ (R). The latter is thus part of (C). Mathematically, this is defined piecewise as
$
  u'_"LF" (t) = cases(
    -E_e e^(a (t - t_e)) sin(pi t \/ t_e)/sin(pi t_e \/ t_p) & 0 <= & t <= t_e & "(O)" &,
    -E_e / (epsilon T_a) ( e^(-epsilon (t - t_e)) - e^(-epsilon (t_c - t_e)) ) quad quad &t_e < &t <= t_c quad quad &"(C, R)"&,
    0 & t_c <= & t <= T & "(C)" &,
  )
$ <eq:lf>
where $bold(theta)_"LF" = {E_e, t_p, t_e, t_c, T_a, T}$ are the six model parameters explained below in @eq:lf-parameters and ${a, epsilon}$ are determined implicitly from the _closure constraint_
$
  integral_0^T u'(t) dif t = 0 quad "such that" quad u(0) = u(T),
$ <eq:closure-constraint>
which holds for any GFM, and the continuity constraint
$
  lim_(t ->_< t_e) u'(t) = lim_(t ->_> t_e) u'(t)
$ <eq:lf-continuity>
which is peculiar to GFMs with smooth return phases rather than hard, discontinuous GCI events @Veldhuis1998.
Note that like most GFMs, the LF model is defined in $u'(t)$ not $u(t)$ due to the radiation effect @eq:suh, though $u(t)$ can be recovered easily via integration @eq:udu.
@fig:lf shows the waveforms for $u'_"LF" (t)$ and $u_"LF" (t)$ for a typical setting of $bold(theta)_"LF"$.
When varying $bold(theta)_"LF"$ the LF waveforms trace a family of broad to narrow asymmetric pulses with smooth to abrupt closure encoding positive ($u(t) >= 0$) glottal flow.

  ],
) <fig:lf>

==== Parameters of the LF model
The LF model achieved broad adoption because it strikes a balance between simplicity and empirical accuracy.
After several iterations, #pcite(<Fant1985>) arrived at this parametrization:
$
  bold(theta)_"LF" = cases(
    E_e & = min_t u'(t) = u'(t_e) quad quad & "peak excitation amplitude",
    t_p & = argmax_t u(t) & "instant of peak glottal flow",
    t_e & = argmin_t u'(t) & "instant of peak excitation",
    t_c && "instant of glottal closure (GCI)",
    T_a && "time constant of the return phase",
    T && "fundamental period",
  )
$ <eq:lf-parameters>
which turned out to be effective in capturing the glottal cycle in both modal and more extreme phonations.
#footnote[
  Actually, #cite(<Fant1985>, form: "author") present LF as a "four-parameter model".
  They ignore $E_e$ and set $T := t_c$ for convenience, thus arriving at a count of four not six as in @eq:lf-parameters.
  In their unifying theory of common GFMs, #pcite(<Doval2006>) also collapse $T$ to $t_c$.
  It is common too in applications (for example, #ncite(<OCinneide2012>)).
  Of course, nothing is really lost because a closed phase of any length can be appended to any GFM by piecewise concatenation.
  We choose to keep $t_c$ distinct from $T$ explicitly because this becomes significant for short return phases and is experimentally observed to be important, especially in clinical scenarios @Rosenberg1971 @Kreiman2007.
]
Note that, apart from $E_e$, which sets the vertical scale, these are all time domain parameters which determine _changepoints_ in the glottal cycle in @fig:glottal-cycle.
These tend to covary significantly and can in fact be regressed into a single convenient parameter $R_d$ @Fant1995.

From the modeling perspective, the most important changepoints are $t_e$ and $t_c$: when these lie close together and return is swift ($T_a$ small and vanishing return phase), the glottal cycle is at peak efficiency and $tilde(u)(t)$ has broadband spectral energy.
This results in a clear voice and sharp features in the speech waveform data $bm(d)$.
Conversely, a smooth return ($T_a$ medium to large) results in a longer return phase with $t_c$ tending to $T$ and the GCI becoming ill-defined.
The result here is a more mellow voice and more smooth features in $bm(d)$.
Both modes are common in voiced speech @Maurer2016 and GIF algorithms must be able to handle both cases.

==== Implementation
In practice, the LF model is unwieldy to compute @Veldhuis1998 @Gobl2017. The closure and continuity constraints in @eq:closure-constraint and @eq:lf-continuity lack an analytical solution, meaning that for each evaluation of $u'(t)$ one must numerically solve for the auxiliary constants ${a, epsilon}$ by a bisection or root-finding routine. This seems like a high price to pay for an analytical model, and worse, this optimization is brittle.
As noted by #pcite(<Perrotin2021>), simplified LF models exist that are perceptually equivalent to LF and easier to work with. Perhaps authors should retire LF altogether.

Nevertheless, it remains the de facto standard in parametric source-filter modeling and we therefore use it here. Our code in @chapter:jaxlf implements the LF equations in JAX @Bradbury2020, so the bisection routines are compiled to native code for a speedup and the entire model is differentiable and easily batcheable.
The code also implements four LF parametrizations, including the previously mentioned $R_d$ formulation of #pcite(<Fant1995>).

=== One of many: the glottal flow âmodel zooâ

#figure(
  image("./fig/gf-models.png", width: 100%),
  placement: bottom,
  caption: [
    *A lineup of GF models* back from 1986 (handdrawn?), together with their derivatives (DGFs). These models are visually very similar. From #cite(<Fujisaki1986>, form: "author").
  ],
) <fig:gf-lineup>

Over the years, a large number of glottal flow models have been proposed in acoustic phonetics. A sample of these is shown in @fig:gf-lineup, already an impressive lineup by 1986. Despite their visual differences, these models are, essentially, variations on a single theme: they all describe a glottal pulse that tracks the periodic opening and closing of the glottis.

#pcite(<Doval2006>) demonstrated that the most common GFMs#footnote[
  These are LF, KLGLOTT88 @Klatt1990, Rosenberg C @Rosenberg1971, R++ @Veldhuis1998.
]
share a common mathematical structure and can be unified under a single framework;
the $bold(theta)_"LF"$ parameters in @eq:lf-parameters can in fact express all of them.
These GFMs all model a glottal flow $u(t)$ that is positive or null, continuous, and typically differentiable except at the glottal closure instant (GCI). Within each period, $u(t)$ rises during the opening phase, falls during the closing phase, and returns to zero during the closed phase, possibly through a short return phase that smooths the closure. The derivative $u'(t)$ alternates positive, zero, and negative in the expected order and integrates to zero over one period, satisfying the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.
It is continuous in case of a nonempty return phase and discontinuous otherwise (meaning a jump at $t_c$ as in @fig:alku), known as hard closure.

==== Allow partial closure?
The strict closure constraint in @eq:closure-constraint is of course just a convenient modeling choice and must be expected to be violated to varying degrees in reality, as real folds often leak, especially in breathy or pathological voices.
On the one hand, it clearly is a defining feature
#footnote[
  The pioneering study on GIF by #pcite(<Miller1959>) had to deconvolve taped speech waveforms with analogue resistor networks and manual optimization.
  A review article on GIF methods notes the part played by the defining quality of the closure constraint in this search for $u(t)$: "the fine-tuning of the resistors of the inverse network was conducted by searching for such values that yielded zero flow after the instant of glottal closure" @Alku2011[p.~626].
]
of the periodic nature of the glottal cycle.
On the other, empirical data show the limits of this hard constraint.
For example, #pcite(<Kreiman2007>, supplement: [p.~601]) observe that
#quote(block: true)[
  in many cases in our data, returning flow derivatives to 0 at the end of the cycle conflicted with the need to match the experimental data and conflicted with the requirement for equal areas under positive and negative curves in the flow derivative. [...] These conflicts between model features, constraints, and the empirical data were handled by abandoning the equal area constraint.#footnote[That "equal area constraint" is just another name for the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.]
]
The approach we take in @chapter:pack is to learn a softened version of the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint from data rather than set it a priori.
This means we learn both whether the flow typically returns to zero and, if not, to what extent this constraint is plausibly violated.

==== Allow negative flow?
Most GFMs enforce a positive glottal flow and assert $u(t) >= 0$. But there are exceptions such as #pcite(<Fujisaki1986>)/*, also noted in #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [p.~35])*/. They allow for
transient negative flow which could represent a lowering of the vocal folds after GCI (presumably when air is sucked back into the lungs).
As with the closure constraint, we will learn this effect from data in @chapter:pack and do not forbid $u(t) < 0$ a priori.

== Classic piecewise polynomial models
<sec:classic-polynomial-models>

// TODO

We make a case for the old "forgotten" family of polynomial GF models such as @Alku2002 @Verdolini1995 @Doval2006:
- Computationally fast, analytical null flow condition
- Many exist in literature guised in orders $n = 0,1,2,3$
- Capable of very sharp events
- "Bright spectrum": very slow decay, so are excellently placed to excite GF

/*
Many other models for the glottal flow exist, including the Rosenberg++ model (Veldhuis, 1998), Fant model (Fant, 1979), Hedelin model (Hedelin,
1984), Childers polynomial model (Childers, 1995), etc. However, the models mentioned in this review are the most prevalent in the literature.

*/

The modern-day revival of piecewise functions (linear, quadratic, ...) puts these ancient models in a new light. Changepoint modeling ("hard ifs") in the guise of decision surfaces is what drives deep architectures today, and it is exactly the same kind we need for GFs. Plus, these models are already embedded in zero DC line (ie, a polynomial of order 0) as they model only open phase.

There are conventially several changepoints in the glottal cycle to be modeled: the primary changepoints are opening onset and closure instant, with optional landmarks like max flow (maximum of $u(t)$) and closing phase onset (minimum of $u'(t)$, start of return phase) used to quantify shape.

We now look at the simplest of the polynomial models in more detail. We will use this model below as a starting point for our generalization to general polynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ and precision $H$, and finally take the limit $H -> oo$.

// TODO until here

=== The triangular pulse model

#figure(
  gnuplot(read("./fig/alku2002.gp")),
  placement: auto,
  caption: [
    *The triangular pulse model* for #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + blue)] $u'_Delta (t)$ and #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + red)] $u_Delta (t)$ during a single period of length $T$.
    The parameters used in this model are identical to @fig:lf, except for the lack of a return phase and that the 'instant' of maximum excitation $t_e$ now spans the interval $[t_p, t_c]$.
  ],
) <fig:alku>

The simplest polynomial model is the _triangular pulse model_ proposed by #pcite(<Alku2002>).
It takes $u(t)$ piecewise linear and $u'(t)$ piecewise constant, as shown in @fig:alku.
Mathematically, the triangular pulse model is given by:
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    +E_e (t_c/t_p - 1) quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_p quad quad & "(O)",
    -E_e quad quad & t_p & < t & <= t_c & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:dgf-piece>
The model has no return phase and only four parameters: $bold(theta)_Delta = {E_e, t_p, t_c, T}$.
Note that the amplitude of the first case in @eq:dgf-piece is fixed because the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint removes one degree of freedom.
#pcite(<Alku2002>) point out that this enables a difficult-to-measure time domain quantity to be expressed as the ratio of two easy-to-measure quantities in the amplitude domain and exploit this fact to measure the open quotient more robustly.


== Parametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:parametric-piecewise-polynomials>

The triangular pulse model @eq:dgf-piece contains two jumps in the derivative $u'_Delta (t)$, so we can write the latter more compactly as a linear combination of two Heaviside functions
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    a_1 (t)_+^0 + a_2 (t - t_p)_+^0 quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:alku-lc>
where $(t)_+^0 = max (0, t)^0$ is the Heaviside function and
$
  a_1 = +E_e (t_c/t_p - 1), quad a_2 = -E_e t_c/t_p.
$
During the open phase, we can interpret the rewritten triangular pulse model as a _parametric piecewise polynomial model_ of _degree_ $d = 0$ and _order_ $H = 2$.
It has parameters $bm(theta)_2 = {bm(a), bm(t)}$ which describe $H = 2$ jumps with amplitudes $bm(a) = (a_1, a_2)^top$ and at changepoint locations $bm(t) = (0, t_p)^top$.
Note that in this formulation the amplitudes $bm(a)$ differ from the piecewise amplitudes in @eq:dgf-piece but are still linearly dependent given $bm(t)$.

Continuing, nothing stops us from generalizing both $H$ and $d$.
The open phase part of @eq:alku-lc becomes:
$
  u'_H (t) = sum_(h=1)^H a_h (t-t_h)_+^d quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)"
$ <eq:udH>
This is the general parametric piecewise polynomial model of degree $d$ and order $H$.//, supported on $[0,t_c]$ (the open phase). // Technically the support operation takes the closure of the interval 0 < t <= t_c so this is correct
Again, its parameters $bm(theta)_H = {bm(a), bm(t)}$ are the amplitudes $bm(a) = (a_1, dots, a_H)^top in bb(R)^H$ and the changepoints $bm(t) = (t_1, dots, t_H)^top in bb(R)^H$.
These scale and shift $H$ piecewise monomials of degree $d$:
$
  (t-t_h)_+^d = max(0, t-t_h)^d = cases(
    0 quad & t < t_h,
    (t-t_h)^d quad & t >= t_h,
  )
$ <eq:repu>
We recognize @eq:repu as the family of activation functions called _rectified power units_ (RePUs).
These include Heaviside for $d = 0$ and the influential ReLU function for $d = 1$, both shown amongst higher degree variants in @fig:repu.
It may sound like a stretch to relate polynomial GFMs to neural nets, but this view of things will pay off greatly in @sec:nonparametric-piecewise when we take the limit $H -> oo$.

=== Regression view

In the context of Bayesian time series regression, @eq:udH is a standard linear model with $H$ fixed basisfunctions (given $bm(t)$) @Bretthorst1988 @ORuanaidh1996.
We may write it as
$
       u'_H (t; bm(theta)_H) & = bm(phi) (t; bm(t))^top bm(a) quad \
  "where" bm(phi) (t; bm(t)) & = [0 < t <= t_c] times vec((t-t_1)_+^d, dots.v, (t-t_H)_+^d) in bb(R)^H \
         "and" bm(a) | bm(t) & ~ cal(N)(bm(a) | bm(0),bm(Sigma)_a).
$ <eq:udH-linear>
We used an Iverson bracket $[0 < t <= t_c]$ in @eq:udH-linear to bake in the compact support during the open phase.


This is an instance of a regression problem with $H$ fixed basisfunctions. Following #pcite(<MacKay1998>),
The addidivity of the $phi$ suggests Gaussian priors for $bm(a)$.

// go to mean and covar formulation in this section
// including k(t,t') = Pi() ( ) (Pi) from phi



==== Closure constraint
Here we derive $bm(Sigma)_a$.

If we assume the $t_(1:K)$ given for now and let $a_k ~ N(0, sigma^2_a)$, then using $integral_(-oo)^t H(tau - c) dif tau = H(t - c)(t - c)$ we get the closure condition for free in expectation:
$
  bb(E)_a [integral_0^T u'(t) dif t] = sum_(k=1)^K bb(E)[a_k] H(T-t_k) (T-t_k) = 0.
$
This motivates setting the mean of the $a$ to zero, otherwise than symmetry of ignorance around $a = 0$.
We can also enforce it: set $b_k = H(T-t_k) (T-t_k) = T - t_k$ then
$
  sum_(k=1)^K a_k b_k = 0 ==> a divides b^top a = 0 ~ cal(N)(0, sigma_a^2 (I - q q^top))
$
where $q = b/(||b||)$. Equivalently,
$
  a = (q q^top) z + (I - q q^top) z, quad z ~ cal(N)(0, sigma_a^2 I). \
  => a = (I - q q^top) z
$
This is a linear constraint on the $a$, so we can update the prior to always respect the constraint. A single constraint projects out the component of $a$ along $b$, so the resulting covariance matrix is degenerate and has rank $K - 1$. A Bayesian way to derive this would make use updating the prior via $D_"KL"$.

This shows how prior of $a$ can encode properties we care about. This is a central theme in what follows: we will find that our priors for the linear amplitude can encode a host of features such as differentiability, closure, ... in other words, the gross features of the expected spectrum of the DGF.

/* picture of triangular pulse model with K=2 ... K = 5 with t_k chosen uniformly and respecting the closure constraint */

In the previous example, we proposed to increase resolution by increasing $K$; we now can add more expressivity by allowing the degree $n$ to be $>= 0$ as well. In this way we also include the higher order classic polynomial models in @sec:classic-polynomial-models.

The general parametric polynomial model of degree $n$ and order $K$ is now
$
      u'(t) & = sum_(k=1)^K a_k (t-t_k)_+^n \
  "where" a & ~ cal(N)(0, sigma_a^2 (I - q q^top)", " t_k in [t_o, t_e] "are given," \
  "and" q_k & = 1/(n+1) (T - t_k)_+^(n+1) = 1/(n+1) (T - t_k)^(n+1)
$
which expresses the DGF as a of changepoints $t_k$ followed by changes of direction according to the amplitude $a_k$. All polynomial models of @sec:classic-polynomial-models can be expressed in this way, with the constraint on $a$ taking into account the closure constraint automatically rather than deriving it for each model (as e.g. in @Doval2006).

==== How good of a GFM is this?


Before doing so, we take a look at how much of viable candidates @eq:udH still are as GFMs.

Differentiable: yes

Domain: yes

No return phase unless very lucky, tiny support

Closure constraint: we could restrict this analytically

Putting priors will enable us to trace out a family of GFMs

=== Connection to neural networks.
<sec:connection-to-neural-networks>

/*
we invoked linearity on the bm(a) to justify gaussian priors, but the bm(t) are also additive within neural network lense
and this suggest a bm(c) parameter to modulate t
*/

In a modern lens, these models can be seen as a neural net with a single hidden layer in the regression setting. $H(t) t$ is a ReLU, etc. This is good, because already a single hidden layer has the universality property. Encouraged, this also suggests the prior $t_k ~ N(0, sigma_t^2)$ truncated to $t_k in [t_0, t_e]$: these are biases in the neural net picture, and we truncate to remain in the open phase.

To summarize what we did: we formulated all classic polynomial DGF models as linear polynomial changepoint models, where the $bold(t)$ changepoints were given hyperparameters. Changepoints are encoded as RePU functions; the closure constraint can be imposed analytically. Next we will bring the $bold(t)$ from hyperparameters to ordinary parameters.

The parameters in the polynomial models are always DGF amplitudes (GF slopes) and changepoints, eg. @Fujisaki1986 Fig 2 has 6 parameters. Other models have other parameters, such as LF, which has 5. These can in principle be approximated to arbitrary precision with piecewise polynomial models, such that their parameters are again just amplitudes and changepoints. This is what we mean by parametric models. Next up we will marginalize over them such that they may

== Nonparametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:nonparametric-piecewise>

After having generalized $n$, now we generalize $H -> oo$. Let $phi(t) = (t)_+^n$ with $n$ given, then the covariance matrix $K$ is given as

/*
We want to show that inf resolution still goes

But we can't do MacKay completely: he has fixed basisfunctions

We need to write again the expectation <f f'> which he could write as sigma <phi phi'> where phi are fixed, and we can't => this is how we get the expectiation over Gaussian weights and we are done

MacKay integrates first over amplitude weight and THEN integrates over input index h, we integrate BOTH over h (resolution) AND weights (prior) simulteaunisky

where $Sigma = "diag"(sigma_1^2, sigma_2^2)$ and the weights are defined in @fig:nn-polynomial. This is the generalized "covariance" arc cosine kernel from @Cho2009 @Pandey2014.

We can absorb $sigma_a$ into $Sigma$, as $arccos$ is homogenous for global rescaling, which is equivalent to rescaling $Sigma -> alpha Sigma$. What is excellent: we managed to push one layer of hyperparameters into the amplitudes! Since we marginalized them away, we end up with a nonparametric polynomial DGF model. We have only three hyperparameters: $sigma$, $sigma_1$, $sigma_2$ instead of $O(H)$ amount. This is the key to fast multiple kernel learning.

But we can allow $bm(Sigma) = mat(sigma_b^2, 0; 0, sigma_t^2)$ as this is important to model behavior of kernel. Introducing a third parameter $rho$ (correlation in $Sigma$) breaks our FT derivation (the $tan "/" arctan$ trick), which assumes no correlation between bias and $t$. So individual rescaling is as far as we can go and probably more than enough. So we can proceed with the $N(0,I)$ case as in @Cho2009. // https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68dfa3181bf88191a3183a8138bf2969



Here the closure constraint becomes analytically "intractable" at first sight, but can be done for SqExp model analytically, and Matern models via Matern expansion trick @Tronarp2018

Kernel support for various GF models without closure constraint

Calculate p(D|k) for k in (arccos, matern, spline) <= nonparametric
Perhaps also a Bayesian network <= parametric

And D is a single open phase of poly (orders <= 3) and nonpoly (order = infty) models

See which kernel or model has most support

Also show # params and compute time for each

==== Neural networks again.
The marginalization above was first done by #pcite(<Cho2009>) in the context of infinite-width neural networks in the style of #pcite(<Neal1996>) #pcite(<Williams1998>). This viewpoint also allows for going beyond a depth 1 network by iteration of the $arccos$ kernel.#footnote[Kernel composition (reiteration) is indeed a valid kernel operation in general, as recently emphasized by @Dutordoir2020.]

==== 
Why not go infinite depth?
Different character from increasing width; effective depth of deep GPs. If stable limit, it becomes independent of inputs @Diaconis1999. Seen often in DGPs as input independency, "forgetting inputs". Though one might counteract that going to infinite width also has similar "unfortunate" consequences (MacKay's baby with the bath water): "features are not learned", basis functions are fixed. This shows that kernel hyperparameters must encode (most of) features. We do this via sparse multiple kernel learning; ie static kernels on the Yoshii-grid mechanism; our hyperparams are $(T, tau, "OQ")$, ie 3 dim grid.

==== Why not spline models?
Piecewise spline models are well-known and effective in low-dimensional nonparametric regression. Why not use them? Because they depend on the resolution. As Gaussian process priors, spline kernels produce posterior means that are splines with knots (hingepoints in some derivative) fixed at the observed inputs and nowhere else @MacKay1998[p. 6]. In contrast, the $arccos(n)$ kernel will learn the effective number of hingepoints from the data, which may happily remain $O(1)$ while the amount of datapoints grows indefinitely. Translated to our problem, we want the number of effective change points to be resolution-independent (independent of the sampling frequency) and not confined to the observation locations.

==== Why not LÃ©vy processes?
These encode Poisson-style jumps $O(1)$ in number in time. But inference in these is always $O("# of jumps")$. So can't really marginalize out these jump points, and we want to avoid MCMC. We want to stack everything in the amplitude marginalization. But, actual discontinuities require LÃ©vy processes; the arc cosine GP alone can only fake it with steep ramps (see @fig:steep).

/* main point here: YES, we compromised; we got fast inference, but also diminshed support for true O(1) amount of jumps like a Levy process would. This is a practical question -- need to find out by running nested sampling and see how much support for these jumps is really there -- just calculate! */

/* This means we should model u(t), not du(t)!

u(t) ~ arccos: arccos is always continuous -- we cant do real jumps

but if we can get du(t) implicitly -- from spectral domain OR via AR pole -- we can maybe cheat this thing

Maybe we can LEARN the radiation characteristic by priming our AR prior to look for that spectral decay of +6db/oct

So we model u(t) * (h(t) * r(t)) and the latter factor of combined VT + radiation impulse response is learned directly

another option is to integrate data (move diff to data) but this possibly nasty

pre-emphasis just flattens spectral slope as to partition poles better -- has nothing to do with radiation factor.
Radition factor can only be undone by integrating, not further diffing.
Pre-emphasis tilts the spectrum "up" by emphasizing higher freqs and is a fitting trick

On the other hand
LPC just proclaims s(t) = e(t) * h(t) and shoves radiation into the source such that h(t) cna remain all-pole
since differentiation is ~ i2pi x => zero, not a pole
so we are generalizing LPC, so also choose e(t) => u(t) * r(t)
