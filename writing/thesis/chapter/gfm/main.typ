= From parametric to nonparametric glottal flow models
<chapter:gfm>

Glottal flow models (GFMs) describe the source signal $u(t)$ as it drives the vocal tract during voiced speech.
These models operate in the time domain because the delicate phase characteristics of the _glottal cycle_ are an integral part of vocal communication.#footnote[
  For example, plosives: glottal stops are micro-events at the millisecond level that underlie semantic information two orders of magnitude higher up the scale.
  The timing of the vocal fold movement is so precisely controlled by our brain that the slightest deviations are studied as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's @Ma2020.
]
// "timing relationships are very important for modelling the glottal flow signal" @Doval2006

Decades of empirical work have over time produced a "model zoo" of GFMs: handcrafted waveforms of $u(t)$ with handfuls of carefully chosen parameters.
Because these are _parametric_ models, they all share the same basic traits: parsimonious, interpretable, but inevitably stiff @Schleusing2012. Their parametric nature limits the range of time domain information they can encode.
This motivates the construction of a family of _nonparametric_ models, which reach for greater expressivity with _less_ parameters.

With the many equations to follow, it is all too easy to lose connection to the actual physical phenomenon being modeled.
After a short look at the glottal cycle, we begin with a review of the classic Liljencrants-Fant model.
Then we revisit the parametric piecewise polynomial models and generalize them to the nonparametric regime, where they are identified with the _arc cosine kernel_ of #pcite(<Cho2009>).
The latter is argued to combine the advantages of both worlds: the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric ones.
This then sets the stage for @chapter:pack, which derives the _periodic arc cosine kernel_ as a learnable surrogate model of synthetic glottal flow data.

) <fig:glottal-cycle>
 
==== The glottal cycle
is the periodic opening and closing of the vocal folds, depicted in @fig:glottal-cycle.
During one _pitch period_, a single cycle is completed, in this case spanning $T = "6 ms"$.
GFMs describe the rate of airflow $u(t)$ [typically expressed in cmÂ³/s] through the opening between the vocal folds called the _glottis_, visible as a black slit in @fig:glottal-cycle.
Importantly, it is not at maximum glottis aperture that the acoustic output is greatest; it is at the sudden _glottal closure instant_ (GCI), as first shown by #pcite(<Miller1959>) in modern literature.
At this point, the moving air column in the vocal tract is abruptly interrupted, and kinetic energy is converted efficiently into acoustic energy which then excites the vocal tract much like plucking a harp or clapping in a resonant room @Chen2016[Section~4.6].
The sharpness of this transition governs much of the clarity and perceived strength of voiced speech @Fant1979.
Thus, efficiency demands that the glottal cycle be strongly asymmetric: a slow buildup of flow during the open phase, followed by a rapid, almost impulsive closure to the closed phase.

== The Liljencrants-Fant model

A model that has been very useful in describing how $u(t)$ varies during the glottal cycle is the _Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model_ proposed by #pcite(<Fant1985>).
It has been the GFM of choice for many joint-inverse filtering approaches#footnote[
  See #section-title-page(<sec:joint-source-filter-methods>).
] but also been studied in its own right.#footnote[
  See #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [Section~2.4]) for a discussion. Research into the LF model falls mainly into study of its spectral characteristics @Doval2006 and (re)parametrization, notably #pcite(<Fant1995>) #pcite(<Perrotin2021>).
]

The model states that $u'(t)$ in a single pitch period of length $T$ consists of three parts, or phases. The _open phase_ (O) is modeled as a rising and falling exponential sinusoid part, and transitions to the _closed phase_ (C) via an exponential return during the _return phase_ (R). The latter is thus part of (C). Mathematically, this is defined piecewise as
$
  u'_"LF" (t) = cases(
    -E_e e^(a (t - t_e)) sin(pi t \/ t_e)/sin(pi t_e \/ t_p) & 0 <= & t <= t_e & "(O)" &,
    -E_e / (epsilon T_a) ( e^(-epsilon (t - t_e)) - e^(-epsilon (t_c - t_e)) ) quad quad &t_e < &t <= t_c quad quad &"(C, R)"&,
    0 & t_c <= & t <= T & "(C)" &,
  )
$ <eq:lf>
where $bold(theta)_"LF" = {E_e, t_p, t_e, t_c, T_a, T}$ are the six model parameters explained below in @eq:lf-parameters and ${a, epsilon}$ are determined implicitly from the _closure constraint_
$
  integral_0^T u'(t) dif t = 0 quad "such that" quad u(0) = u(T),
$ <eq:closure-constraint>
which holds for any GFM, and the continuity constraint
$
  lim_(t ->_< t_e) u'(t) = lim_(t ->_> t_e) u'(t)
$ <eq:lf-continuity>
which is peculiar to GFMs with smooth return phases rather than hard, discontinuous GCI events @Veldhuis1998.
Note that like most GFMs, the LF model is defined in $u'(t)$ not $u(t)$ due to the radiation effect @eq:suh, though $u(t)$ can be recovered easily via integration @eq:udu.
@fig:lf shows the waveforms for $u'_"LF" (t)$ and $u_"LF" (t)$ for a typical setting of $bold(theta)_"LF"$.
When varying $bold(theta)_"LF"$ the LF waveforms trace a family of broad to narrow asymmetric pulses with smooth to abrupt closure encoding positive ($u(t) >= 0$) glottal flow.

  ],
) <fig:lf>

==== Parameters of the LF model
The LF model achieved broad adoption because it strikes a balance between simplicity and empirical accuracy.
After several iterations, #pcite(<Fant1985>) arrived at this parametrization:
$
  bold(theta)_"LF" = cases(
    E_e & = min_t u'(t) = u'(t_e) quad quad & "peak excitation amplitude",
    t_p & = argmax_t u(t) & "instant of peak glottal flow",
    t_e & = argmin_t u'(t) & "instant of peak excitation",
    t_c && "instant of glottal closure (GCI)",
    T_a && "time constant of the return phase",
    T && "fundamental period",
  )
$ <eq:lf-parameters>
which turned out to be effective in capturing the glottal cycle in both modal and more extreme phonations.
#footnote[
  Actually, #cite(<Fant1985>, form: "author") present LF as a "four-parameter model".
  They ignore $E_e$ and set $T := t_c$ for convenience, thus arriving at a count of four not six as in @eq:lf-parameters.
  In their unifying theory of common GFMs, #pcite(<Doval2006>) also collapse $T$ to $t_c$.
  It is common too in applications (for example, #ncite(<OCinneide2012>)).
  Of course, nothing is really lost because a closed phase of any length can be appended to any GFM by piecewise concatenation.
  We choose to keep $t_c$ distinct from $T$ explicitly because this becomes significant for short return phases and is experimentally observed to be important, especially in clinical scenarios @Rosenberg1971 @Kreiman2007.
]
Note that, apart from $E_e$, which sets the vertical scale, these are all time domain parameters which determine _changepoints_ in the glottal cycle in @fig:glottal-cycle.
These tend to covary significantly and can in fact be regressed into a single convenient parameter $R_d$ @Fant1995.

From the modeling perspective, the most important changepoints are $t_e$ and $t_c$: when these lie close together and return is swift ($T_a$ small and vanishing return phase), the glottal cycle is at peak efficiency and $tilde(u)(t)$ has broadband spectral energy.
This results in a clear voice and sharp features in the speech waveform data $bm(d)$.
Conversely, a smooth return ($T_a$ medium to large) results in a longer return phase with $t_c$ tending to $T$ and the GCI becoming ill-defined.
The result here is a more mellow voice and more smooth features in $bm(d)$.
Both modes are common in voiced speech @Maurer2016 and GIF algorithms must be able to handle both cases.

==== Implementation
In practice, the LF model is unwieldy to compute @Veldhuis1998 @Gobl2017. The closure and continuity constraints in @eq:closure-constraint and @eq:lf-continuity lack an analytical solution, meaning that for each evaluation of $u'(t)$ one must numerically solve for the auxiliary constants ${a, epsilon}$ by a bisection or root-finding routine. This seems like a high price to pay for an analytical model, and worse, this optimization is brittle.
As noted by #pcite(<Perrotin2021>), simplified LF models exist that are perceptually equivalent to LF and easier to work with. Perhaps authors should retire LF altogether.

Nevertheless, it remains the de facto standard in parametric source-filter modeling and we therefore use it here. Our code in @chapter:jaxlf implements the LF equations in JAX @Bradbury2020, so the bisection routines are compiled to native code for a speedup and the entire model is differentiable and easily batcheable.
The code also implements four LF parametrizations, including the previously mentioned $R_d$ formulation of #pcite(<Fant1995>).

=== One of many: the glottal flow âmodel zooâ

#figure(
  image("./fig/gf-models.png", width: 100%),
  placement: bottom,
  caption: [
    *A lineup of GF models* back from 1986 (handdrawn?), together with their derivatives (DGFs). These models are visually very similar. From #cite(<Fujisaki1986>, form: "author").
  ],
) <fig:gf-lineup>

Over the years, a large number of glottal flow models have been proposed in acoustic phonetics. A sample of these is shown in @fig:gf-lineup, already an impressive lineup by 1986. Despite their visual differences, these models are, essentially, variations on a single theme: they all describe a glottal pulse that tracks the periodic opening and closing of the glottis.

#pcite(<Doval2006>) demonstrated that the most common GFMs#footnote[
  These are LF, KLGLOTT88 @Klatt1990, Rosenberg C @Rosenberg1971, R++ @Veldhuis1998.
]
share a common mathematical structure and can be unified under a single framework;
the $bold(theta)_"LF"$ parameters in @eq:lf-parameters can in fact express all of them.
These GFMs all model a glottal flow $u(t)$ that is positive or null, continuous, and typically differentiable except at the glottal closure instant (GCI). Within each period, $u(t)$ rises during the opening phase, falls during the closing phase, and returns to zero during the closed phase, possibly through a short return phase that smooths the closure. The derivative $u'(t)$ alternates positive, zero, and negative in the expected order and integrates to zero over one period, satisfying the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.
It is continuous in case of a nonempty return phase and discontinuous otherwise (meaning a jump at $t_c$ as in @fig:alku), known as hard closure.

==== Allow partial closure?
The strict closure constraint in @eq:closure-constraint is of course just a convenient modeling choice and must be expected to be violated to varying degrees in reality, as real folds often leak, especially in breathy or pathological voices.
On the one hand, it clearly is a defining feature
#footnote[
  The pioneering study on GIF by #pcite(<Miller1959>) had to deconvolve taped speech waveforms with analogue resistor networks and manual optimization.
  A review article on GIF methods notes the part played by the defining quality of the closure constraint in this search for $u(t)$: "the fine-tuning of the resistors of the inverse network was conducted by searching for such values that yielded zero flow after the instant of glottal closure" @Alku2011[p.~626].
]
of the periodic nature of the glottal cycle.
On the other, empirical data show the limits of this hard constraint.
For example, #pcite(<Kreiman2007>, supplement: [p.~601]) observe that
#quote(block: true)[
  in many cases in our data, returning flow derivatives to 0 at the end of the cycle conflicted with the need to match the experimental data and conflicted with the requirement for equal areas under positive and negative curves in the flow derivative. [...] These conflicts between model features, constraints, and the empirical data were handled by abandoning the equal area constraint.#footnote[That "equal area constraint" is just another name for the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.]
]
The approach we take in @chapter:pack is to learn a softened version of the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint from data rather than set it a priori.
This means we learn both whether the flow typically returns to zero and, if not, to what extent this constraint is plausibly violated.

==== Allow negative flow?
Most GFMs enforce a positive glottal flow and assert $u(t) >= 0$. But there are exceptions such as #pcite(<Fujisaki1986>)/*, also noted in #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [p.~35])*/. They allow for
transient negative flow which could represent a lowering of the vocal folds after GCI (presumably when air is sucked back into the lungs).
As with the closure constraint, we will learn this effect from data in @chapter:pack and do not forbid $u(t) < 0$ a priori.

== Classic piecewise polynomial models
<sec:classic-polynomial-models>

// TODO

We make a case for the old "forgotten" family of polynomial GF models such as @Alku2002 @Verdolini1995 @Doval2006:
- Computationally fast, analytical null flow condition
- Many exist in literature guised in orders $n = 0,1,2,3$
- Capable of very sharp events
- "Bright spectrum": very slow decay, so are excellently placed to excite GF

/*
Many other models for the glottal flow exist, including the Rosenberg++ model (Veldhuis, 1998), Fant model (Fant, 1979), Hedelin model (Hedelin,
1984), Childers polynomial model (Childers, 1995), etc. However, the models mentioned in this review are the most prevalent in the literature.

*/

The modern-day revival of piecewise functions (linear, quadratic, ...) puts these ancient models in a new light. Changepoint modeling ("hard ifs") in the guise of decision surfaces is what drives deep architectures today, and it is exactly the same kind we need for GFs. Plus, these models are already embedded in zero DC line (ie, a polynomial of order 0) as they model only open phase.

There are conventially several changepoints in the glottal cycle to be modeled: the primary changepoints are opening onset and closure instant, with optional landmarks like max flow (maximum of $u(t)$) and closing phase onset (minimum of $u'(t)$, start of return phase) used to quantify shape.

We now look at the simplest of the polynomial models in more detail. We will use this model below as a starting point for our generalization to general polynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ and precision $H$, and finally take the limit $H -> oo$.

// TODO until here

=== The triangular pulse model

#figure(
  gnuplot(read("./fig/alku2002.gp")),
  placement: auto,
  caption: [
    *The triangular pulse model* for #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + blue)] $u'_Delta (t)$ and #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + red)] $u_Delta (t)$ during a single period of length $T$.
    The parameters used in this model are identical to @fig:lf, except for the lack of a return phase and that the 'instant' of maximum excitation $t_e$ now spans the interval $[t_p, t_c]$.
  ],
) <fig:alku>

The simplest polynomial model is the _triangular pulse model_ proposed by #pcite(<Alku2002>).
It takes $u(t)$ piecewise linear and $u'(t)$ piecewise constant, as shown in @fig:alku.
Mathematically, the triangular pulse model is given by:
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    +E_e (t_c/t_p - 1) quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_p quad quad & "(O)",
    -E_e quad quad & t_p & < t & <= t_c & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:dgf-piece>
The model has no return phase and only four parameters: $bold(theta)_Delta = {E_e, t_p, t_c, T}$.
Note that the amplitude of the first case in @eq:dgf-piece is fixed because the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint removes one degree of freedom.
#pcite(<Alku2002>) point out that this enables a difficult-to-measure time domain quantity to be expressed as the ratio of two easy-to-measure quantities in the amplitude domain and exploit this fact to measure the open quotient more robustly.


== Parametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:parametric-piecewise-polynomials>

The triangular pulse model @eq:dgf-piece contains two jumps in the derivative $u'_Delta (t)$, so we can write the latter more compactly as a linear combination of two Heaviside functions
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    a_1 (t - b_1)_+^0 + a_2 (t - b_2)_+^0 quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:alku-lc>
where $(t-b)_+^0 = mono("Heaviside")(t-b)$ and
$
  bm(a) = vec(a_1, a_2) = E_e vec(t_c/t_p - 1, -t_c/t_p), quad quad
  bm(b) = vec(b_1, b_2) = vec(0, t_p).
$
During the open phase, we can interpret the rewritten triangular pulse model as a _parametric piecewise polynomial model_ of _degree_ $d = 0$ and _order_ $H = 2$.
It has parameters $bm(theta)_2 = {bm(a), bm(b)}$ which describe $H = 2$ jumps with amplitudes $bm(a)$ at locations $bm(b)$.
Note that in this formulation the amplitudes $bm(a)$ differ from the piecewise amplitudes in @eq:dgf-piece but are still linearly dependent given the changepoints $bm(b)$ and $t_c$.

Continuing, nothing stops us from generalizing both $H$ and $d$.
The open phase part of @eq:alku-lc becomes:
$
  u'_H (t) = sum_(h=1)^H a_h (t-b_h)_+^d quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)"
$ <eq:udH>
This is the general parametric piecewise polynomial model of degree $d$ and order $H$.//, supported on $[0,t_c]$ (the open phase). // Technically the support operation takes the closure of the interval 0 < t <= t_c so this is correct
Again, its parameters $bm(theta)_H = {bm(a), bm(b)}$ are the amplitudes $bm(a) = (a_1, dots, a_H)^top in bb(R)^H$ and the changepoints $bm(b) = (b_1, dots, b_H)^top in bb(R)^H$.
These scale and shift $H$ piecewise monomials of degree $d$:
$
  (t-b)_+^d = (t-b)^d mono("Heaviside")(t-b) = cases(
    0 quad & t < b,
    (t-b)^d quad & t >= b,
  )
$ <eq:repu>
We recognize @eq:repu as the family of activation functions called _rectified power units_ (RePUs).
These include Heaviside for $d = 0$ and the influential ReLU function for $d = 1$, both shown among higher degree variants in @fig:repu.
It may sound like a stretch to relate polynomial GFMs to neural nets, but this view of things will pay off greatly in @sec:nonparametric-piecewise when we take the limit $H -> oo$.

) <fig:repu>

=== Regression view

GFMs ultimately play the role of regression models in the GIF problem.
From this point of view, the general parametric model in @eq:udH is just a standard linear model,
and we will now develop it into a Bayesian regression model following #pcite(<MacKay1998>).

Suppose we observe $N$ time samples $bold(t) = {t_n}_(n=1)^N$ during one glottal cycle, and fix $H$ basis functions of the form
$
  phi.alt_h (t) = /*[0 < t <= t_c] times*/ (t - b_h)_+^d,
$ <eq:phi-iverson>
where /*we used an Iverson bracket $[0 < t <= t_c]$ to bake in the compact support during the open phase, and*/ the changepoints $bm(b)$ and $t_c$ are treated as given.
Collecting these into the design matrix $bm(Phi) in bb(R)^(N times H)$ with
$
  Phi_(n h) = phi.alt_h (t_n),
$
the general parametric model during /*both open and closed phase*/ the open phase becomes simply
$
  bm(u') = bm(Phi) bm(a).
$ <eq:udphia>
This is linear in the amplitudes $bm(a)$ given $bm(Phi)$, so the model is rather constrained at this point.
Indeed, $bm(a)$ is currently the only source of variability and power in this model because we assume all other parameters fixed.
Which prior then for $bm(a)$ should we choose?
If we want to maximize model support while adhering to the known additivity and power constraints, the optimal choice
is the canonical Gaussian prior over amplitudes @Bretthorst1988:
$
  p(bm(a) | bm(b)) = mono("Normal")(bm(a) | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(I)).
$ <eq:pab>

==== Closure constraint
The closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint becomes
$
  integral_0^T u'_H (t) dif t = sum_(h=1)^H a_h integral_0^t_c phi.alt_h (t) dif t = sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h = 0,
$ <eq:arh-constraint>
with $r_h = (t_c - b_h)^(d+1)\/(d+1)$.
Observe that the prior @eq:pab already satisfies the closure constraint in expectation:
$
  bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b)) [sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h] = sum_(h=1)^H bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[a_h] thin r_h = 0.
$
This motivates setting the prior mean of the $bm(a)$ to zero, otherwise than symmetry of ignorance around $bm(a) = bm(0)$.
We can also enforce it:#footnote[
  The general solution is given by $argmin_f D_"KL" [f(bm(a)) || p(bm(a) | bm(b))]$ under the constraint @eq:arh-constraint, but the closure under linear conditioning of Gaussian distributions allow us to take a shortcut here.
]
$
  sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h = 0 ==> p(bm(a) | bm(b), thin bm(r)^top bm(a) = 0) = mono("Normal")(bm(a) | bm(0), sigma_a^2 (bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top))
$ <eq:arh-prior>
where $bm(r) = (r_1, dots, r_H)^top$ and $bm(q) = bm(r)/(||bm(r)||)$.
A convenient way to a sample from this updated prior makes use of the fact that this is a rank-one projection:
$
  &bm(a) &equiv& (bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(a) + &(&bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) &bm(a)& quad &~& quad p(bm(a) & | & bm(b)) \
  ==> &bm(a)_perp &=& &(&bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) &bm(a)& quad &~& quad p(bm(a) & | & bm(b), thin bm(r)^top bm(a) = 0).
$
How does this look in data space?
Compared to samples from the isotropic prior @eq:pab,
the anisotropic prior @eq:arh-prior induces glottal flows $bm(u)$ that tend to look more pulse-like.
// TODO: figure here
/* picture of triangular pulse model with K=2 ... K = 5 with t_k chosen uniformly and respecting the closure constraint */
Likewise, regression with the latter ensures that posterior mass vanishes at solutions $bm(u)$ that violate the closure constraint.

This illustrates how linear constraints on the amplitudes $bm(a)$ in the linear model @eq:udphia can encode GFM properties at the cost of just a few rank-one downdates.
Moving on from linear models to Gaussian processes, these linear constraints become linear functionals called _interdomain features_, which may be used to impose structure directly in function space, without touching rank, but more challenging mathematically.
In @chapter:pack, we will use the interdomain approach to learn spectral features of nonparametric GFMs directly from synthetic data rather than hardcoding them as in @eq:arh-constraint.

Finally, observe that the analytical solution @eq:arh-prior to the closure constraint is valid for any degree $d >= 0$ and order $H >= 1$, so the classic polynomial models listed in @sec:classic-polynomial-models can all be expressed in our linear model framework given suitable choices of $bm(b)$ and $t_c$.

=== Connection to neural networks
<sec:connection-to-neural-networks>

In fact, due to connection with neural networks, it is easy to see that not only polynomial but _general_ GFMs can be expressed with sufficients $H(d)$ where for a given level of approximation $epsilon$ the number $H(d)$ needed depends on $d$.

As said before, this model is very constrained to lie on submanifold of dim $H$.
even rank $K-1$ with the constraint
we should add more expressiveness
we can do so to add a prior for $bm(b)$ so we don't have to assume anymore that this is fixed
and go to a full rank GP (rank goes to $N$, not $H$)
for this we will loose the closure constraint for now but reimpose it in the next chapter

/*
we invoked linearity on the bm(a) to justify gaussian priors, but the bm(t) are also additive within neural network lense
and this suggest a bm(c) parameter to modulate t
*/


Moving on to data space, the prior probability of $bm(u')$ is also Gaussian,
$
  p(bm(u') | bm(b)) /* = integral p(bm(u') | bm(a), bm(b)) p(bm(a) | bm(b)) dif bm(a) */ = mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top),
$ <eq:udashgauss>
since
$
             expval(bm(u')) & = bm(Phi) expval(bm(a)) = 0, \
  // mono(E)_bm(a)[bm(u')] &= bm(Phi) expval(bm(a)) = 0, \
  expval(bm(u') bm(u')^top) & = bm(Phi) expval(bm(a) bm(a)^top) bm(Phi)^top = sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top.
$
where the expectations $expval(dot)$ were taken with respect to @eq:pab.

In a modern lens, these models can be seen as a neural net with a single hidden layer in the regression setting. $H(t) t$ is a ReLU, etc. This is good, because already a single hidden layer has the universality property. Encouraged, this also suggests the prior $t_k ~ N(0, sigma_t^2)$ truncated to $t_k in [t_0, t_e]$: these are biases in the neural net picture, and we truncate to remain in the open phase.

To summarize what we did: we formulated all classic polynomial DGF models as linear polynomial changepoint models, where the $bold(t)$ changepoints were given hyperparameters. Changepoints are encoded as RePU functions; the closure constraint can be imposed analytically. Next we will bring the $bold(t)$ from hyperparameters to ordinary parameters.

The parameters in the polynomial models are always DGF amplitudes (GF slopes) and changepoints, eg. @Fujisaki1986 Fig 2 has 6 parameters. Other models have other parameters, such as LF, which has 5. These can in principle be approximated to arbitrary precision with piecewise polynomial models, such that their parameters are again just amplitudes and changepoints. This is what we mean by parametric models. Next up we will marginalize over them such that they may


/* now we got a prior for t_k: we can show samples */
/* K, n picture */

== Nonparametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:nonparametric-piecewise>

We now let the number of polynomial pieces go to infinity and study what this limit accomplishes. The finite model in @eq:udH is linear in its amplitudes and thus a standard linear regression model once the changepoints are fixed. The next step is to assign independent Gaussian priors to all parameters and ask what happens when the number of terms becomes large.

==== Random feature model
As suggested by the analogy to neural networks in the previous section, we take independent Gaussian priors
$
  a_h ~^"i.i.d." mono("Normal")(0, sigma_a^2), quad
  b_h ~^"i.i.d." mono("Normal")(0, sigma_b^2), quad
  c_h ~^"i.i.d." mono("Normal")(0, sigma_c^2),
$
and define the random-feature representation
$
  u'_H (t) = (1/sqrt(H)) sum_(h=1)^H a_h phi.alt (t; b_h, c_h),
$
where $phi.alt (t; b, c) = (c t - b)_+^d$.
The factor $1/sqrt(H)$ ensures that the total variance of $u'_H (t)$ stays of order one as $H$ grows.

==== Conditional Gaussian
Let $bm(t) = (t_1, dots, t_m)$ be a set of input points and $bm(Phi)$ the corresponding feature matrix introduced earlier, with entries
$
  Phi_(n h) = phi.alt (t_n; b_h, c_h).
$
Given the random features $\{(b_h, c_h)\}_(h=1)^H$, the vector $u'_H (bm(t))$ is a linear combination of Gaussian amplitudes. It is therefore exactly
$
  u'_H (bm(t)) | \{(b_h, c_h)\}
  ~ mono("Normal")(bm(0), (sigma_a^2/H) bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top).
$
We define
$
  bm(Q)_H (bm(t)) = (1/H) bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top
$
as the _empirical kernel matrix_ for the chosen feature realization.

==== Law of large numbers and the population kernel

Each entry of $bm(Q)_H (bm(t))$ is an empirical average of independent terms
$
  [bm(Q)_H (bm(t))]_(n n') = (1/H) sum_(h=1)^H phi.alt (t_n; b_h, c_h) phi.alt (t_(n'); b_h, c_h).
$
By the law of large numbers this converges almost surely to its expectation under the feature prior:
$
  bm(Q)_H (bm(t)) --> bm(K)(bm(t)) "a.s.",
  quad [bm(K)(bm(t))]_(n n') = E_(b,c) [phi.alt (t_n; b, c) phi.alt (t_(n'); b, c)].
$
This expectation is what we call the _population kernel_: it is the covariance of one random feature evaluated at two input points. The only role of the limit $H -> oo$ is to make the Monte Carlo estimate $bm(Q)_H (bm(t))$ converge to this known quantity.

==== Degenerating mixture --> single Gaussian

Unconditionally, $u'_H (bm(t))$ is a mixture of Gaussians because its covariance depends on the randomly drawn features:
$
  p(u'_H (bm(t))) =
  integral mono("Normal")(bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Q)_H (bm(t))) \, p(bm(Q)_H (bm(t))) \, d bm(Q)_H.
$
As $H$ increases, the distribution of $bm(Q)_H (bm(t))$ concentrates around its expectation $bm(K)(bm(t))$. In the limit, it collapses to a point mass:
$
  p(bm(Q)_H (bm(t))) --> delta(bm(Q)_H - bm(K)).
$
The mixture thus _degenerates_: the only remaining randomness is due to the Gaussian amplitudes. The marginal distribution becomes
$
  u'_H (bm(t)) --> mono("Normal")(bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(K)(bm(t))).
$
Since this holds for any finite set of evaluation points, the limiting process is a Gaussian process with covariance $sigma_a^2 K(t, t')$.

==== What the limit actually accomplishes

The limit $H -> oo$ does not create Gaussianityâit is already there, conditional on the features. What the limit does is remove the randomness in the empirical kernel by letting the Monte Carlo average converge to its population mean:
$
  (1/H) sum_h phi.alt (t; b_h, c_h) phi.alt (t'; b_h, c_h)
  --> E_(b,c) [phi.alt (t; b, c) phi.alt (t'; b, c)].
$
This is the only real effect of the limit: it fixes the covariance function once and for all.

==== Arc-cosine kernel with affine augmentation

To make this explicit, write the affine feature parameters as
$
  tilde(w) = (c, -b), quad tilde(x)(t) = (t, 1),
$
so that
$
  phi.alt (t; b, c) = (tilde(w)^top tilde(x)(t))_+^d.
$
With the Gaussian prior
$
  tilde(w) ~ mono("Normal")(bm(0), "diag"(sigma_c^2, sigma_b^2)),
$
the population kernel becomes
$
  K(t, t') =
  E_(tilde(w)) [(tilde(w)^top tilde(x)(t))_+^d (tilde(w)^top tilde(x)(t'))_+^d].
$
Up to a constant scaling determined by $(sigma_b^2, sigma_c^2)$ and the degree $d$, this is the degreeâ$d$ _arcâcosine kernel_ of #pcite(<Cho2009>) on the augmented inputs $(t, 1)$. A fixed rescaling of inputs or outputs can absorb the constant, so we drop it below.

==== Two kinds of averaging

To close, recall that there are two distinct averages at play:
(1) the $1/sqrt(H)$ average in the definition of the function $u'_H (t)$, which keeps its variance finite, and
(2) the $1/H$ average in the kernel estimator $hat(K)_H (t, t')$, which ensures that the empirical kernel converges to $K(t, t')$.
The first governs the distribution over functions, the second governs the convergence of their covariance. Together they give the Gaussian process limit with kernel $sigma_a^2 K(t, t')$.

==== What happened?
It is worth pausing to ask what really happened here.
At first sight, taking $H -> oo$ might seem like an act of reckless generalization: we blow up the number of parameters without bound, yet somehow end up with something *simpler*âa single Gaussian process with a fixed kernel. Conditional on the random features, the model was already Gaussian, so the only effect of the limit is that the *random design itself* stops being random. The empirical kernel freezes to its mean, and with it the whole architecture of the network becomes a static, deterministic map from inputs to covariances.

This is the peculiar balance of the Gaussian process limit. The randomness of finite networks (the accident of which features you drew) disappears, while the *expressive field* of possible functions becomes infinite. What looks like a loss of freedom in one space is a gain of freedom in another. You trade a random, highâdimensional parameterization for a deterministic law over an infiniteâdimensional function space. The model collapses in its parameter dimension but expands in its functional reach. That is the sense in which the GP limit achieves âinfinite resolutionâ: it no longer needs to enumerate features to approximate every smooth behavior the kernel supports. The prior already spans that continuum.

This connects directly to the remark by MacKay (1998) about âthrowing out the baby with the bathwater.â
MacKay warned that when one marginalizes out parameters too earlyâwhen one keeps only the covariance structure and discards the explicit representation of weightsâone may lose intuition about how learning actually works. In our case, the GP limit *is* that marginalization, pushed to its logical extreme. The baby (the random feature machinery) is gone, but its bathwaterâthe covariance it left behindâturns out to be everything. The Gaussian process is the distilled trace of that infinite hidden layer, the residual law that remains once we have averaged over all its possible microscopic configurations. The cost is that we can no longer âseeâ the mechanism that created a particular function; the benefit is that the resulting prior is perfectly wellâdefined, smooth, and tractable.

So the infiniteâwidth limit does not so much simplify the neural network as *clarify* it: by letting the networkâs structural noise disappear, it reveals the underlying stochastic law that every large random feature model was already approximating in miniature.

CHATGPT QUESTION

Given iid Gaussian priors for $a, b, c$,
$
  phi(t) = a phi.alt (t \; b, c)
$
is a random feature.
Thus
$
  1/H u'_H (t) = 1/H sum_(h=1)^H phi_h (t)
$
is a central limit theorem-kind of sum that will converge to a normal distribution for $H -> oo$.
Therefore we characterize the marginal of $phi(t)$, ie $p(phi(t))$ by its moments:
$
  E_w phi(t) &= 0 \
  E_w (phi(t) phi(t')) &= sigma_a^2 k(t, t') \
  E_w (phi(t) phi(t') phi(t'')) &= f(t, t', t'') != 0 "in general" \
  &"etc."
$
Now by CLT the limit
$
  lim_(H -> oo) 1/H u'_H (t) ~ mono("Normal")(0, sigma_a^2 k(t,t))
$
and higher order moments don't matter anymore; the GP is a full description.

But how could the limit we are actually interested in,
$
  lim_(H -> oo) 1/H [u'_H (t) u'_H (t')] = sigma_a^2 k(t,t)

$
enter the picture in the way I want to develop the story here?
Is this even correct?
CLT only talks about marginal variance of a single variable?
But have $t$ AND $t'$ here... two variables $u'(t)$ and $u'(t')$, not a single one.
How would you do this?
I don't want painstaken precision but I do want to be very clear what $H -> oo$ accomplishes, because my prior assumptions on this derivation were kinda misguided.

AND we will do this in a generalized way for soft closure constraint in next section
*/

/*
We now turn to the limit where the number of changepoints $H$ becomes large.
Recall the general model
$
  u'_H (t) = sum_(h=1)^H a_h phi.alt (t; b_h, c_h),
$
with
$
  phi.alt (t; b, c) = [0 < t <= t_c] (c t - b)_+^d.
$
Each term is a random featureâone draw from the population of piecewise polynomial responses.
Given the priors defined earlier for $a_h, b_h, c_h$, all draws are i.i.d.

We can now ask: what happens to this model as $H$ increases?

The mean of $u'_H$ is trivial:
$
  E_(bm(w))[u'_H(t)]
  = sum_(h=1)^H E_(a_h)[a_h] E_(b_h,c_h)[phi.alt (t; b_h, c_h)] = 0.
$
The covariance, conditional on $(bm(b), bm(c))$, is
$
  Q_(n n') = E_(a)[u'_H(t_n) u'_H(t_{n'}) | bm(b), bm(c)]
  = sigma_a^2 (bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top)_(n n'),
$
where $Phi_(n h) = phi.alt (t_n; b_h, c_h)$.
This is just the regression covariance from before, but now the design matrix itself is random.

Averaging also over $(bm(b), bm(c))$ converts the finite sum into a Monte Carlo estimate of a kernel integral:
$
  E_(bm(b), bm(c))[Q_(n n')]
  = H sigma_a^2 E_(b, c)[phi.alt (t_n; b, c) phi.alt (t_{n'}; b, c)].
$
Hence each additional hidden unit adds another sample from the same base measure, refining the empirical estimate of the kernel.
Writing
$
  K_d (t, t') = E_(b, c)[phi.alt (t; b, c) phi.alt (t'; b, c)]
  = [0 < t <= t_c][0 < t' <= t_c] E_(b, c)[(c t - b)_+^d (c t' - b)_+^d],
$
we have
$
  E_(bm(w))[Q_(n n')] = H sigma_a^2 K_d (t_n, t_{n'}).
$

To keep variance finite as $H$ grows, set $sigma_a^2 = sigma^2 / H$.
Then
$
  E_(bm(w))[Q_(n n')] -> sigma^2 K_d (t_n, t_{n'}),
$
and the finite sum becomes a Monte Carlo quadrature of the kernel integral in expectation.
As $H -> oo$, the empirical measure $(1/H) sum_h delta_(b_h, c_h)$ converges to its generating distribution, so the random-feature model converges in distribution to a Gaussian process
$
  lim_(H -> oo) u'_H(t) ~ mono("Gaussian process")(0, sigma^2 K_d (t, t')).
$

The base measure for $(b, c)$ determines the shape of $K_d$.
Taking $(b, c) ~ mono("Normal")((0, 0), "diag"(sigma_b^2, sigma_c^2))$ maximizes entropy given fixed second moments and admits a closed form.
Defining augmented variables
$
  tilde(w) = (c, -b), quad tilde(x) = (t, 1),
$
we can write $phi.alt (t; b, c) = (tilde(w)^top tilde(x))_+^d$.
Under the Gaussian base measure for $tilde(w)$ this becomes the *degree-$d$ arc-cosine kernel* of #pcite(<Cho2009>):
$
  K_d(t, t') = [0 < t <= t_c][0 < t' <= t_c] k_d (tilde(x), tilde(x')).
$

/*
WAIT still need to scale $k(sigma_c t, sigma_c)$ or the like because prior is NOT N(0,1).
*/

Unlike in the original derivation of #pcite(<Williams1998>), bounded transfer functions are not required; it suffices that $phi.alt (t; b, c)$ has finite variance under the Gaussian weight prior, which holds for any finite $d$ #pcite(<Matthews2018>).

In this view, increasing $H$ increases the *Monte Carlo resolution* with which the regression model samples its feature space.
The nonparametric limit replaces explicit random changepoints with their continuous Gaussian measure, yielding a Gaussian process prior over $u'(t)$ whose covariance is the arc-cosine kernel restricted to the open phase of the glottal cycle.

In data space,

  &= H sigma_a^2 K_phi.alt(t, t')
$
Here $u'_H$ has zero mean because $a_h$ is zero mean and independent of $b_h, c_h$.
Likewise, only the diagonal terms with $h = ell$ survive due to independence of amplitudes $a_h, a_ell$.
Here
$
  K_phi.alt(t, t') &= [0 < t <= t_c] times [0 < t' <= t_c] times \

  &= [0 < t <= t_c] times [0 < t' <= t_c] times k_d (t, t') \
$
Here $k_d (t,t')$ is the arc cosine kernel of @Cho2009.
Taking the limit $H -> oo$ and letting $sigma_a^2$ scale as $sigma^2\/H$ to keep variance finite, we get
$
  lim_(H -> oo) E_bm(w)[u'_H (t)] &= 0 \
  lim_(H -> oo) E_bm(w)[u'_H (t) u'_H (t')] &= sigma^2 [0 < t <= t_c] times [0 < t' <= t_c] times k_d (t, t') := k(t, t')
$
and higher moments are zero due to the central limit theorem.
Thus in the limit $H -> oo$,
$
  lim_(H -> oo) u'_H(t) ~ mono("Gaussian process")(0, sigma^2 k (t, t'))

questions:
- transfer functions are not bounded unlike in Williams -- this does not cause problems?
* answer: no:
Unlike in the original derivation of #pcite(<Williams1998>), we do not require the hidden-unit transfer functions to be bounded; it is sufficient that their outputs have finite variance under the weight prior as was shown in #pcite(<Matthews2018>). For $(C t - B)_+^d$ with Gaussian weights $B, C$, this holds for any finite $d$ and $t$, and the infinite-width limit then yields the degree-$d$ arc-cosine kernel #pcite(<Cho2009>).


- the H -> oo limit only matters to make higher order moments vanish? in this case for any finite H we'd still just have a rescaled arc cosine kernel?
- so what does that limit actually accomplish here? i thought it would give us infinite resolution (since oo amount of changepoints) but that seems untrue. i am confused as in MacKay 1998 he derivs RBF kernel as sum of RBF basisfunctions taking limit to oo amount. but we do something different here... but i cant put my finger on it. having a hard time to explain this properly to a relatively GP-inexperienced jury

where $Sigma = "diag"(sigma_1^2, sigma_2^2)$ and the weights are defined in @fig:nn-polynomial. This is the generalized "covariance" arc cosine kernel from @Cho2009 @Pandey2014.

We can absorb $sigma_a$ into $Sigma$, as $arccos$ is homogenous for global rescaling, which is equivalent to rescaling $Sigma -> alpha Sigma$. What is excellent: we managed to push one layer of hyperparameters into the amplitudes! Since we marginalized them away, we end up with a nonparametric polynomial DGF model. We have only three hyperparameters: $sigma$, $sigma_1$, $sigma_2$ instead of $O(H)$ amount. This is the key to fast multiple kernel learning.

But we can allow $bm(Sigma) = mat(sigma_b^2, 0; 0, sigma_t^2)$ as this is important to model behavior of kernel. Introducing a third parameter $rho$ (correlation in $Sigma$) breaks our FT derivation (the $tan "/" arctan$ trick), which assumes no correlation between bias and $t$. So individual rescaling is as far as we can go and probably more than enough. So we can proceed with the $N(0,I)$ case as in @Cho2009. // https://chatgpt.com/s/t_68dfa3181bf88191a3183a8138bf2969

==== Neural networks again.
The marginalization above was first done by #pcite(<Cho2009>) in the context of infinite-width neural networks in the style of #pcite(<Neal1996>) #pcite(<Williams1998>). This viewpoint also allows for going beyond a depth 1 network by iteration of the $arccos$ kernel.#footnote[Kernel composition (reiteration) is indeed a valid kernel operation in general, as recently emphasized by @Dutordoir2020.]

==== Why not go infinite depth?
Different character from increasing width; effective depth of deep GPs. If stable limit, it becomes independent of inputs @Diaconis1999. Seen often in DGPs as input independency, "forgetting inputs". Though one might counteract that going to infinite width also has similar "unfortunate" consequences (MacKay's baby with the bath water): "features are not learned", basis functions are fixed. This shows that kernel hyperparameters must encode (most of) features. We do this via sparse multiple kernel learning; ie static kernels on the Yoshii-grid mechanism; our hyperparams are $(T, tau, "OQ")$, ie 3 dim grid.

==== Why not spline models?
Piecewise spline models are well-known and effective in low-dimensional nonparametric regression. Why not use them? Because they depend on the resolution. As Gaussian process priors, spline kernels produce posterior means that are splines with knots (hingepoints in some derivative) fixed at the observed inputs and nowhere else @MacKay1998[p. 6]. In contrast, the $arccos(n)$ kernel will learn the effective number of hingepoints from the data, which may happily remain $O(1)$ while the amount of datapoints grows indefinitely. Translated to our problem, we want the number of effective change points to be resolution-independent (independent of the sampling frequency) and not confined to the observation locations.

==== Why not LÃ©vy processes?
These encode Poisson-style jumps $O(1)$ in number in time. But inference in these is always $O("# of jumps")$. So can't really marginalize out these jump points, and we want to avoid MCMC. We want to stack everything in the amplitude marginalization. But, actual discontinuities require LÃ©vy processes; the arc cosine GP alone can only fake it with steep ramps (see @fig:steep).

/* main point here: YES, we compromised; we got fast inference, but also diminshed support for true O(1) amount of jumps like a Levy process would. This is a practical question -- need to find out by running nested sampling and see how much support for these jumps is really there -- just calculate! */

/* This means we should model u(t), not du(t)!

u(t) ~ arccos: arccos is always continuous -- we cant do real jumps

but if we can get du(t) implicitly -- from spectral domain OR via AR pole -- we can maybe cheat this thing

Maybe we can LEARN the radiation characteristic by priming our AR prior to look for that spectral decay of +6db/oct

So we model u(t) * (h(t) * r(t)) and the latter factor of combined VT + radiation impulse response is learned directly

another option is to integrate data (move diff to data) but this possibly nasty

pre-emphasis just flattens spectral slope as to partition poles better -- has nothing to do with radiation factor.
Radition factor can only be undone by integrating, not further diffing.
Pre-emphasis tilts the spectrum "up" by emphasizing higher freqs and is a fitting trick

On the other hand
LPC just proclaims s(t) = e(t) * h(t) and shoves radiation into the source such that h(t) cna remain all-pole
since differentiation is ~ i2pi x => zero, not a pole
so we are generalizing LPC, so also choose e(t) => u(t) * r(t)

// maybe put this in summary

Before doing so, we take a look at how much of viable candidates @eq:udH still are as GFMs.

Differentiable: yes

Domain: yes

No return phase unless very lucky, tiny support

Closure constraint: we could restrict this analytically

Putting priors will enable us to trace out a family of GFMs
