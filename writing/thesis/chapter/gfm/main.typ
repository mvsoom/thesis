= From parametric to nonparametric glottal flow models
<chapter:gfm>

Glottal flow models (GFMs) describe the source signal $u(t)$ as it drives the vocal tract during voiced speech.
These models operate in the time domain because the delicate phase characteristics of the _glottal cycle_ are an integral part of vocal communication.#footnote[
  For example, plosives: glottal stops are micro-events at the millisecond level that underlie semantic information two orders of magnitude higher up the scale.
  The timing of the vocal fold movement is so precisely controlled by our brain that the slightest deviations are studied as biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's @Ma2020.
]
// "timing relationships are very important for modelling the glottal flow signal" @Doval2006

Decades of empirical work have over time produced a "model zoo" of GFMs: handcrafted waveforms of $u(t)$ with handfuls of carefully chosen parameters.
Because these are _parametric_ models, they all share the same basic traits: parsimonious, interpretable, but inevitably stiff @Schleusing2012. Their parametric nature limits the range of time domain information they can encode.
This motivates the construction of a family of _nonparametric_ models, which reach for greater expressivity with _less_ parameters.

With the many equations to follow, it is all too easy to lose connection to the actual physical phenomenon being modeled.
After a short look at the glottal cycle, we begin with a review of the classic Liljencrants-Fant model.
Then we revisit the parametric piecewise polynomial models and generalize them to the nonparametric regime, where they are identified with the _arc cosine kernel_ of #pcite(<Cho2009>).
The latter is argued to combine the advantages of both worlds: the interpretability of parametric models with the flexibility of nonparametric ones.
This then sets the stage for @chapter:pack, which derives the _periodic arc cosine kernel_ as a learnable surrogate model of synthetic glottal flow data.

) <fig:glottal-cycle>
 
==== The glottal cycle
is the periodic opening and closing of the vocal folds, depicted in @fig:glottal-cycle.
During one _pitch period_, a single cycle is completed, in this case spanning $T = "6 ms"$.
GFMs describe the rate of airflow $u(t)$ [typically expressed in cmÂ³/s] through the opening between the vocal folds called the _glottis_, visible as a black slit in @fig:glottal-cycle.
Importantly, it is not at maximum glottis aperture that the acoustic output is greatest; it is at the sudden _glottal closure instant_ (GCI), as first shown by #pcite(<Miller1959>) in modern literature.
At this point, the moving air column in the vocal tract is abruptly interrupted, and kinetic energy is converted efficiently into acoustic energy which then excites the vocal tract much like plucking a harp or clapping in a resonant room @Chen2016[Section~4.6].
The sharpness of this transition governs much of the clarity and perceived strength of voiced speech @Fant1979.
Thus, efficiency demands that the glottal cycle be strongly asymmetric: a slow buildup of flow during the open phase, followed by a rapid, almost impulsive closure to the closed phase.

== The Liljencrants-Fant model

A model that has been very useful in describing how $u(t)$ varies during the glottal cycle is the _Liljencrants-Fant (LF) model_ proposed by #pcite(<Fant1985>).
It has been the GFM of choice for many joint-inverse filtering approaches#footnote[
  See #section-title-page(<sec:joint-source-filter-methods>).
] but also been studied in its own right.#footnote[
  See #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [Section~2.4]) for a discussion. Research into the LF model falls mainly into study of its spectral characteristics @Doval2006 and (re)parametrization, notably #pcite(<Fant1995>) #pcite(<Perrotin2021>).
]

The model states that $u'(t)$ in a single pitch period of length $T$ consists of three parts, or phases. The _open phase_ (O) is modeled as a rising and falling exponential sinusoid part, and transitions to the _closed phase_ (C) via an exponential return during the _return phase_ (R). The latter is thus part of (C). Mathematically, this is defined piecewise as
$
  u'_"LF" (t) = cases(
    -E_e e^(a (t - t_e)) sin(pi t \/ t_e)/sin(pi t_e \/ t_p) & 0 <= & t <= t_e & "(O)" &,
    -E_e / (epsilon T_a) ( e^(-epsilon (t - t_e)) - e^(-epsilon (t_c - t_e)) ) quad quad &t_e < &t <= t_c quad quad &"(C, R)"&,
    0 & t_c <= & t <= T & "(C)" &,
  )
$ <eq:lf>
where $bold(theta)_"LF" = {E_e, t_p, t_e, t_c, T_a, T}$ are the six model parameters explained below in @eq:lf-parameters and ${a, epsilon}$ are determined implicitly from the _closure constraint_
$
  integral_0^T u'(t) dif t = 0 quad "such that" quad u(0) = u(T),
$ <eq:closure-constraint>
which holds for any GFM, and the continuity constraint
$
  lim_(t ->_< t_e) u'(t) = lim_(t ->_> t_e) u'(t)
$ <eq:lf-continuity>
which is peculiar to GFMs with smooth return phases rather than hard, discontinuous GCI events @Veldhuis1998.
Note that like most GFMs, the LF model is defined in $u'(t)$ not $u(t)$ due to the radiation effect @eq:suh, though $u(t)$ can be recovered easily via integration @eq:udu.
@fig:lf shows the waveforms for $u'_"LF" (t)$ and $u_"LF" (t)$ for a typical setting of $bold(theta)_"LF"$.
When varying $bold(theta)_"LF"$ the LF waveforms trace a family of broad to narrow asymmetric pulses with smooth to abrupt closure encoding positive ($u(t) >= 0$) glottal flow.

  ],
) <fig:lf>

==== Parameters of the LF model
The LF model achieved broad adoption because it strikes a balance between simplicity and empirical accuracy.
After several iterations, #pcite(<Fant1985>) arrived at this parametrization:
$
  bold(theta)_"LF" = cases(
    E_e & = min_t u'(t) = u'(t_e) quad quad & "peak excitation amplitude",
    t_p & = argmax_t u(t) & "instant of peak glottal flow",
    t_e & = argmin_t u'(t) & "instant of peak excitation",
    t_c && "instant of glottal closure (GCI)",
    T_a && "time constant of the return phase",
    T && "fundamental period",
  )
$ <eq:lf-parameters>
which turned out to be effective in capturing the glottal cycle in both modal and more extreme phonations.
#footnote[
  Actually, #cite(<Fant1985>, form: "author") present LF as a "four-parameter model".
  They ignore $E_e$ and set $T := t_c$ for convenience, thus arriving at a count of four not six as in @eq:lf-parameters.
  In their unifying theory of common GFMs, #pcite(<Doval2006>) also collapse $T$ to $t_c$.
  It is common too in applications (for example, #ncite(<OCinneide2012>)).
  Of course, nothing is really lost because a closed phase of any length can be appended to any GFM by piecewise concatenation.
  We choose to keep $t_c$ distinct from $T$ explicitly because this becomes significant for short return phases and is experimentally observed to be important, especially in clinical scenarios @Rosenberg1971 @Kreiman2007.
]
Note that, apart from $E_e$, which sets the vertical scale, these are all time domain parameters which determine _changepoints_ in the glottal cycle in @fig:glottal-cycle.
These tend to covary significantly and can in fact be regressed into a single convenient parameter $R_d$ @Fant1995.

From the modeling perspective, the most important changepoints are $t_e$ and $t_c$: when these lie close together and return is swift ($T_a$ small and vanishing return phase), the glottal cycle is at peak efficiency and $tilde(u)(t)$ has broadband spectral energy.
This results in a clear voice and sharp features in the speech waveform data $bm(d)$.
Conversely, a smooth return ($T_a$ medium to large) results in a longer return phase with $t_c$ tending to $T$ and the GCI becoming ill-defined.
The result here is a more mellow voice and more smooth features in $bm(d)$.
Both modes are common in voiced speech @Maurer2016 and GIF algorithms must be able to handle both cases.

==== Implementation
In practice, the LF model is unwieldy to compute @Veldhuis1998 @Gobl2017. The closure and continuity constraints in @eq:closure-constraint and @eq:lf-continuity lack an analytical solution, meaning that for each evaluation of $u'(t)$ one must numerically solve for the auxiliary constants ${a, epsilon}$ by a bisection or root-finding routine. This seems like a high price to pay for an analytical model, and worse, this optimization is brittle.
As noted by #pcite(<Perrotin2021>), simplified LF models exist that are perceptually equivalent to LF and easier to work with. Perhaps authors should retire LF altogether.

Nevertheless, it remains the de facto standard in parametric source-filter modeling and we therefore use it here. Our code in @chapter:jaxlf implements the LF equations in JAX @Bradbury2020, so the bisection routines are compiled to native code for a speedup and the entire model is differentiable and easily batcheable.
The code also implements four LF parametrizations, including the previously mentioned $R_d$ formulation of #pcite(<Fant1995>).

=== One of many: the glottal flow âmodel zooâ
<sec:model-zoo>

#figure(

  placement: bottom,
  caption: [
    *A lineup of GF models* back from 1986 (handdrawn?), together with their derivatives (DGFs). These models are visually very similar. From #cite(<Fujisaki1986>, form: "author").
  ],
) <fig:gf-lineup>

Over the years, a large number of glottal flow models have been proposed in acoustic phonetics. A sample of these is shown in @fig:gf-lineup, already an impressive lineup by 1986. Despite their visual differences, these models are, essentially, variations on a single theme: they all describe a glottal pulse that tracks the periodic opening and closing of the glottis.

#pcite(<Doval2006>) demonstrated that the most common GFMs#footnote[
  These are LF, KLGLOTT88 @Klatt1990, Rosenberg C @Rosenberg1971, R++ @Veldhuis1998.
]
share a common mathematical structure and can be unified under a single framework;
the $bold(theta)_"LF"$ parameters in @eq:lf-parameters can in fact express all of them.
These GFMs all model a glottal flow $u(t)$ that is positive or null, continuous, and typically differentiable except at the glottal closure instant (GCI). Within each period, $u(t)$ rises during the opening phase, falls during the closing phase, and returns to zero during the closed phase, possibly through a short return phase that smooths the closure. The derivative $u'(t)$ alternates positive, zero, and negative in the expected order and integrates to zero over one period, satisfying the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.
It is continuous in case of a nonempty return phase and discontinuous otherwise (meaning a jump at $t_c$ as in @fig:alku), known as hard closure.

==== Allow partial closure?
The strict closure constraint in @eq:closure-constraint is of course just a convenient modeling choice and must be expected to be violated to varying degrees in reality, as real folds often leak, especially in breathy or pathological voices.
On the one hand, it clearly is a defining feature
#footnote[
  The pioneering study on GIF by #pcite(<Miller1959>) had to deconvolve taped speech waveforms with analogue resistor networks and manual optimization.
  A review article on GIF methods notes the part played by the defining quality of the closure constraint in this search for $u(t)$: "the fine-tuning of the resistors of the inverse network was conducted by searching for such values that yielded zero flow after the instant of glottal closure" @Alku2011[p.~626].
]
of the periodic nature of the glottal cycle.
On the other, empirical data show the limits of this hard constraint.
For example, #pcite(<Kreiman2007>, supplement: [p.~601]) observe that
#quote(block: true)[
  in many cases in our data, returning flow derivatives to 0 at the end of the cycle conflicted with the need to match the experimental data and conflicted with the requirement for equal areas under positive and negative curves in the flow derivative. [...] These conflicts between model features, constraints, and the empirical data were handled by abandoning the equal area constraint.#footnote[That "equal area constraint" is just another name for the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint.]
]
The approach we take in @chapter:pack is to learn a softened version of the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint from data rather than set it a priori.
This means we learn both whether the flow typically returns to zero and, if not, to what extent this constraint is plausibly violated.

==== Allow negative flow?
Most GFMs enforce a positive glottal flow and assert $u(t) >= 0$. But there are exceptions such as #pcite(<Fujisaki1986>)/*, also noted in #pcite(<Degottex2010>, supplement: [p.~35])*/. They allow for
transient negative flow which could represent a lowering of the vocal folds after GCI (presumably when air is sucked back into the lungs).
As with the closure constraint, we will learn this effect from data in @chapter:pack and do not forbid $u(t) < 0$ a priori.

Polynomial GFMs occupy an interesting corner of the "model zoo."
They fit into the same piecewise framework we have been using for the LF model, but with each part modeled as a polynomial of degree $d$.
We list several GFMs proposed in the literature in @table:polys.

This class of GFMs mainly appeal to simplicity and spectral strength.
Piecewise polynomial models admit an analytical solution to the closure constraint while remaining computationally cheap.
More importantly, the sharp transitions generated by low-order polynomials have bright spectra with slow decay, which is exactly what it takes to model hard GCIs @Childers1994.

To get a feel for these models, we now turn to the simplest case: $d = 0$.

/*

We make a case for the old "forgotten" family of polynomial GF models such as @Alku2002 @Verdolini1995 @Doval2006:
- Computationally fast, analytical null flow condition
- Many exist in literature guised in orders $n = 0,1,2,3$
- Capable of very sharp events
- "Bright spectrum": very slow decay, so are excellently placed to excite GF


The modern-day revival of piecewise functions (linear, quadratic, ...) puts these ancient models in a new light. Changepoint modeling ("hard ifs") in the guise of decision surfaces is what drives deep architectures today, and it is exactly the same kind we need for GFs. Plus, these models are already embedded in zero DC line (ie, a polynomial of order 0) as they model only open phase.

There are conventially several changepoints in the glottal cycle to be modeled: the primary changepoints are opening onset and closure instant, with optional landmarks like max flow (maximum of $u(t)$) and closing phase onset (minimum of $u'(t)$, start of return phase) used to quantify shape.

We now look at the simplest of the polynomial models in more detail. We will use this model below as a starting point for our generalization to general polynomials of arbitrary degree $n$ and precision $H$, and finally take the limit $H -> oo$.

=== The triangular pulse model
<sec:triangular-pulse-model>

#figure(
  gnuplot(read("./fig/alku2002.gp")),
  placement: auto,
  caption: [
    *The triangular pulse model* for #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + blue)] $u'_Delta (t)$ and #box(baseline: -3pt)[#line(length: 1.5em, stroke: 1.3pt + red)] $u_Delta (t)$ during a single period of length $T$.
    The parameters used in this model are identical to @fig:lf, except for the lack of a return phase and that the 'instant' of maximum excitation $t_e$ now spans the interval $[t_p, t_c]$.
  ],
) <fig:alku>

The simplest polynomial model is the _triangular pulse model_ proposed by #pcite(<Alku2002>).
It takes $u(t)$ piecewise linear and $u'(t)$ piecewise constant, as shown in @fig:alku.
Mathematically, the triangular pulse model is given by:
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    +E_e (t_c/t_p - 1) quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_p quad quad & "(O)",
    -E_e quad quad & t_p & < t & <= t_c & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:dgf-piece>
The model has no return phase and only four parameters: $bold(theta)_Delta = {E_e, t_p, t_c, T}$.
Note that the amplitude of the first case in @eq:dgf-piece is fixed because the closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint removes one degree of freedom.
#pcite(<Alku2002>) point out that this enables a difficult-to-measure time domain quantity to be expressed as the ratio of two easy-to-measure quantities in the amplitude domain and exploit this fact to measure the open quotient more robustly.


== Parametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:parametric-piecewise-polynomials>

The triangular pulse model @eq:dgf-piece contains two jumps in the derivative $u'_Delta (t)$, so we can write the latter more compactly as a linear combination of two Heaviside functions
$
  u'_Delta (t) = cases(
    a_1 (t - b_1)_+^0 + a_2 (t - b_2)_+^0 quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)",
    0 quad quad & t_c & < t & <= T & "(C)",
  )
$ <eq:alku-lc>
where $(t-b)_+^0 = mono("Heaviside")(t-b)$ and
$
  bm(a) = vec(a_1, a_2) = E_e vec(t_c/t_p - 1, -t_c/t_p), quad quad
  bm(b) = vec(b_1, b_2) = vec(0, t_p).
$
During the open phase, we can interpret the rewritten triangular pulse model as a _parametric piecewise polynomial model_ of _degree_ $d = 0$ and _order_ $H = 2$.
It has parameters $bm(theta)_2 = {bm(a), bm(b)}$ which describe $H = 2$ jumps with amplitudes $bm(a)$ at locations $bm(b)$.
Note that in this formulation the amplitudes $bm(a)$ differ from the piecewise amplitudes in @eq:dgf-piece but are still linearly dependent given the changepoints $bm(b)$ and $t_c$.

Continuing, nothing stops us from generalizing both $H$ and $d$.
The open phase part of @eq:alku-lc becomes:
$
  u'_H (t) = sum_(h=1)^H a_h (t-b_h)_+^d quad quad & 0 & < t & <= t_c quad quad & "(O)"
$ <eq:udH>
This is the general parametric piecewise polynomial model of degree $d$ and order $H$.//, supported on $[0,t_c]$ (the open phase). // Technically the support operation takes the closure of the interval 0 < t <= t_c so this is correct
Again, its parameters $bm(theta)_H = {bm(a), bm(b)}$ are the amplitudes $bm(a) = (a_1, dots, a_H)^top in bb(R)^H$ and the changepoints $bm(b) = (b_1, dots, b_H)^top in bb(R)^H$.
These scale and shift $H$ piecewise monomials of degree $d$:
$
  (t-b)_+^d = (t-b)^d mono("Heaviside")(t-b) = cases(
    0 quad & t < b,
    (t-b)^d quad & t >= b,
  )
$ <eq:repu>
We recognize @eq:repu as the family of activation functions called _rectified power units_ (RePUs).
These include Heaviside for $d = 0$ and the influential ReLU function for $d = 1$, both shown among higher degree variants in @fig:repu.
It may sound like a stretch to relate polynomial GFMs to neural nets, but this view of things will pay off greatly in @sec:nonparametric-piecewise when we take the limit $H -> oo$.

=== Regression view
<sec:regression-view>

GFMs ultimately play the role of regression models in the GIF problem.
From this point of view, the general parametric model in @eq:udH is just a standard _linear model_,
and we will now develop it into a Bayesian regression model following #pcite(<MacKay1998>).

Suppose we observe $N$ time samples $bold(t) = {t_n}_(n=1)^N$ during one glottal cycle, and fix $H$ basis functions of the form
$
  phi.alt_h (t) = /*[0 < t <= t_c] times*/ (t - b_h)_+^d,
$ <eq:phi-iverson>
where /*we used an Iverson bracket $[0 < t <= t_c]$ to bake in the compact support during the open phase, and*/ the changepoints $bm(b)$ and $t_c$ are treated as given.
Collecting these into the design matrix $bm(Phi) in bb(R)^(N times H)$ with
$
  [bm(Phi)]_(n h) = phi.alt_h (t_n),
$
the general parametric model during /*both open and closed phase*/ the open phase becomes simply
$
  bm(u') = bm(Phi) bm(a).
$ <eq:udphia>
This is linear in the amplitudes $bm(a)$ given $bm(Phi)$, so the model is rather constrained at this point.
Indeed, $bm(a)$ is currently the only source of variability and power in this model because we assume all other parameters fixed.
Which prior then for $bm(a)$ should we choose?
If we want to maximize model support while adhering to the known additivity and power constraints, the optimal choice
is the canonical Gaussian prior over amplitudes @Bretthorst1988:
$
  p(bm(a) | bm(b)) = mono("Normal")(bm(a) | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(I)).
$ <eq:pab>
Moving on to data space, the induced prior probability of $bm(u')$ is also Gaussian,
$
  p(bm(u') | bm(b)) = integral delta(bm(u') - bm(Phi) bm(a)) thin p(bm(a) | bm(b)) dif bm(a) = mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top),
$ <eq:udashgauss>
due to closure of the Gaussian under linear combinations, and
$
  bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[bm(u')] & = bm(Phi) thin bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[bm(a)] = 0, \
  bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[bm(u') bm(u')^top] & = bm(Phi) thin bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[bm(a) bm(a)^top] thin bm(Phi)^top = sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top.
$ <eq:abexpval>
Because $"rank"(bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top) â¤ H$, prior samples of $bm(u')$ are intrinsically confined to an $H$-dimensional subspace of $bb(R)^N$.
Assuming $H < N$, we thus see that linear models like @eq:udphia are inherently low-rank.
Their expressivity grows with $H$ and saturates when $H$ reaches $N$.

==== Closure constraint
The closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint becomes
$
  integral_0^T u'_H (t) dif t = sum_(h=1)^H a_h integral_0^t_c phi.alt_h (t) dif t = sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h = 0,
$ <eq:arh-constraint>
with $r_h = (t_c - b_h)^(d+1)\/(d+1)$.
Observe that the prior @eq:pab already satisfies the closure constraint in expectation:
$
  bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b)) [sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h] = sum_(h=1)^H bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b))[a_h] thin r_h = 0.
$
This motivates setting the prior mean of the $bm(a)$ to zero, otherwise than symmetry of ignorance around $bm(a) = bm(0)$.
We can also enforce it:#footnote[
  The general solution is given by $argmin_f D_"KL" [f(bm(a)) || p(bm(a) | bm(b))]$ under the constraint @eq:arh-constraint, but the closure under linear conditioning of Gaussian distributions allow us to take a shortcut here.
]
$
  sum_(h=1)^H a_h r_h = 0 ==> p(bm(a) | mono("closure"), bm(b)) = mono("Normal")(bm(a) | bm(0), sigma_a^2 (bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top))
$ <eq:arh-prior>
where $bm(r) = (r_1, dots, r_H)^top$ and $bm(q) = bm(r)/(||bm(r)||)$.
A convenient way to a sample from this updated prior makes use of the fact that this is a rank-one projection:
$
  bm(a)        &= (bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(a) + &(bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(a) quad ~ quad & p(bm(a) | bm(b)) \
  ==> bm(a)_perp &= &(bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(a)                       quad ~ quad  & p(bm(a) | mono("closure"), bm(b)).
$
How does this look in data space?
By the same calculation @eq:abexpval, marginalizing over $bm(a)$ yields
$
  p(bm(u') | mono("closure"), bm(b)) = mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) (bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(Phi)^top).
$ <eq:udashani>
We can then obtain $bm(u)$ from $bm(u')$ via integration using @eq:udu.
Compared to samples from the isotropic prior @eq:udashgauss,
the anisotropic prior @eq:udashani induces glottal flows $bm(u)$ that tend to look more pulse-like.
// TODO: figure here
/* picture of triangular pulse model with K=2 ... K = 5 with t_k chosen uniformly and respecting the closure constraint */
Likewise, regression with the latter ensures that posterior mass vanishes at solutions $bm(u)$ that violate the closure constraint.

This illustrates how linear constraints on the amplitudes $bm(a)$ in the linear model @eq:udphia can encode GFM properties at the cost of just a single rank-one downdate per constraint.
Moving on from linear models to Gaussian processes, these linear constraints become linear functionals known as _interdomain features_, which may be used to impose structure directly in function space, without touching rank, but more challenging mathematically.
In @chapter:pack, we will use the interdomain approach to learn spectral features of nonparametric GFMs directly from data rather than hardcoding them as in @eq:arh-constraint.

==== Connection to classic polynomial models
Observe that the analytical solution @eq:arh-prior to the closure constraint is valid for any degree $d >= 0$ and order $H >= 1$, so each classic polynomial model listed in @table:polys can be expressed in our linear model framework given suitable choices of $bm(b)$ and $t_c$, without specialized derivations.

  ],
  gap: 1em,
) <fig:nn-polynomial>

@fig:nn-polynomial illustrates that the triangular pulse model of @sec:triangular-pulse-model can be seen as a tiny neural network.
Likewise, the general parametric piecewise polynomial model @eq:udH can be recast as a single hidden layer of width $H$ with a RePU activation and a linear readout:
$
  u'_"NN" (t) = sum_(h=1)^H a_h (c_h t - b_h)_+^d.
$ <eq:uNN>
Each unit computes $phi.alt_h (t) = (bm(w)_h^top bm(x)_t)_+^d$ with hidden weights $bm(w)_h = (c_h, -b_h)^top$ and $bm(x)_t = (1, t)^top$, exactly like a neuron with a bias input.
The $3H$ parameters of the neural net are thus $bm(a)$ and $bm(b)$ (as before) and the newly acquired degrees of freedom $bm(c) = (c_1, dots, c_H)^top$.

Seen from this point of view, a natural symmetry appears.
We argued in @sec:regression-view that in linear regression context the output weights $bm(a)$ are best assigned an uninformative Gaussian prior, so
$
  p(bm(a)) = mono("Normal")(bm(a) & | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(I)).
$ <eq:priora>
But the neural network equivalence makes very clear that the hidden weights ${bm(b), bm(c)}$ actually play similar roles:
they enter linearly inside the activation, so the same argument applies, and we are encouraged to assign Gaussians again:
$
  p(bm(b)) = mono("Normal")(bm(b) | bm(0), sigma_b^2 bm(I)), quad p(bm(c)) = mono("Normal")(bm(c) | bm(0), sigma_c^2 bm(I)).
$ <eq:priorbc>
This step is not obvious from the viewpoint of any of the GFMs we've discussed before, where changepoints $bm(b)$ were nonlinear hyperparameters fixed a priori; here they become "active" and "linear" degrees of freedom.
Assuming $t_c$ is known, the remaining hyperparameters to describe the open phase are thus the three scales ${sigma_a, sigma_b, sigma_c}$ controlling amplitude, typical changepoint location, and horizontal stretch, respectively.

Turning to data space again and having assigned priors to all parameters, we can now do a full marginalization unlike the conditional in @eq:udashgauss.
Updating the design matrix $bm(Phi)$ to
$
  [bm(Phi)]_(n h) = phi.alt_h (t_n) = (c_h t_n - b_h)_+^d,
$ <eq:nnphi>
and assuming the isotropic priors @eq:priora and @eq:priorbc
we have
$
  p(bm(u'))
  &= integral delta(bm(u') - bm(Phi) bm(a)) thin p(bm(a)) thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)) dif bm(a) dif bm(b) dif bm(c) \
  &= integral mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top) thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)) dif bm(b) dif bm(c).
$ <eq:pu-gaussmixture>
This is a Gaussian mixture with varying covariances (not means) as $bm(Phi)$ depends on the hidden weights ${bm(b), bm(c)}$.
//It is easy to sample from @eq:pu-gaussmixture, but
A closed form for this integral exists only for $H -> oo$ as $p(bm(u'))$ converges to a Gaussian process, as we will see in @sec:nonparametric-piecewise.

==== Closure constraint
The closure constraint @eq:closure-constraint given ${bm(b), bm(c)}$ remains a linear condition on $bm(a)$, so we can define
$
  p(bm(a), bm(b), bm(c) | mono("closure")) = p(bm(a) | mono("closure"), bm(b), bm(c)) thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)),
$ <eq:abc-closure>
where $p(bm(a) | mono("closure"), bm(b), bm(c))$ is identical to @eq:arh-prior but with $r_h = (c_h t_c - b_h)_+^(d+1) \/ c_h (d+1)$.
/* $ r_h = integral_0^T phi.alt_h (t) dif t = integral_0^(t_c) (c_h t - b_h)_+^d dif t = (c_h t_c - b_h)_+^(d+1) \/ c_h (d+1)$. */
This prior yields a mixture in data space that is similar to @eq:pu-gaussmixture:
$
  p(bm(u') | mono("closure")) = integral mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) (bm(I) - bm(q) bm(q)^top) bm(Phi)^top) thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)) dif bm(b) dif bm(c).
$ <eq:ccbmu>
Here both $bm(q) = bm(r)/(||bm(r)||)$ and $bm(Phi)$ depend on ${bm(b), bm(c)}$.
This integral has no closed form for $H -> oo$, but we can still impose the closure constraint on @eq:pu-gaussmixture indirectly in the spectral domain via interdomain features (@chapter:pack).

// TODO: samples of this are shown in Fig XXX

==== Connection to LF and other GFMs
The neural network view of the parametric polynomial model also clarifies expressivity.
It is well known that a single RePU layer of sufficient width can approximate any continuous waveform on a bounded interval @Hornik1993.
Therefore, with its analytical closure constraint @eq:abc-closure and the ability to represent sharp changepoint behavior, the parametric piecewise polynomial model in the form @eq:uNN effectively unifies the entire family of GFMs encountered in the literature, from triangular pulses to LF-type exponentials and sinusoids, given /*a precision tolerance and a*/ sufficiently large $H$.

/* now we got a prior for t_k: we can show samples */
/* K, n picture */

== Nonparametric piecewise polynomial models
<sec:nonparametric-piecewise>

The correspondence of piecewise polynomials GFMs with a single hidden layer shows that their expressivity depends mostly on the order $H$, as model order is equivalent to layer width in the neural network picture.
Indeed, _parametric_ linear models have a finite representation capacity determined primarily by rank because the modeled function can only explore the subspace spanned by the basisfunctions.
#footnote[
  More precisely: a higher rank naturally enlarges the subspace of attainable functions, but the prior over amplitudes still constrains where probability mass is placed within that subspace.
Geometrically, the model explores an $H$-dimensional ellipsoid like @eq:udashgauss or @eq:udashani rather than the entire hyperplane.
When data accumulate, the prior constraints are eventually overwhelmed and the model can move freely on that plane.
Random kitchen sinks @Rahimi2008 take these two ideas to the extreme: forgo specialized modeling; just use $H$ _random_ basis functions with uninformative priors and rely on the fact that an entire $H$-dimensional hyperplane is reachable with high probability.
]
_Nonparametric_ models grow capacity as the number of datapoints increases;
in the case of Gaussian processes, posterior inference given $N$ datapoints is equivalent to Bayesian linear regression with $N$ linearly independent basisfunctions, hence full-rank @Rasmussen2006.

It thus makes sense to consider the limit $H -> oo$ in our search for more expressive GFMs. //,  for the neural network model @eq:uNN in data space.
Continuing where we left, we already saw in @eq:pu-gaussmixture that $p(bm(u'))$ is a nontrivial Gaussian covariance mixture weighed by the isotropic priors defined in @eq:priorbc.
This can be made explicit:
$
  p(bm(u'))
  &= integral mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top)
     thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)) dif bm(b) dif bm(c) \
  &= integral mono("Normal")(bm(u') | bm(0), bm(Q))
     thin p(bm(Q)) dif bm(Q),
$ <eq:uprime-mix>
where we defined the push forward
$
  p(bm(Q)) = integral delta(bm(Q) - sigma_a^2 bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top) thin p(bm(b)) thin p(bm(c)) dif bm(b) dif bm(c)
$ <eq:Q-push-forward>
which essentially counts the number of ${bm(b), bm(c)}$ configurations that give rise to a given $bm(Q)$.
#share-align[
  Thus each random draw of ${bm(b), bm(c)} in bb(R)^(2H)$ drawn from @eq:priorbc induces in data space a random covariance matrix $bm(Q) in bb(R)^(N times N)$,
  $ 
    {bm(b), bm(c)} mapsto bm(Q), quad quad &"rank"(bm(Q)) &<= H&
  $
  and hence a Gaussian component with weight $p(bm(Q))$ in the mixture @eq:uprime-mix.
  Below we will show that by rescaling $sigma_a -> sigma_a\/sqrt(H)$ and letting $H -> oo$, the density of states degenerates to
  $ 
   p(bm(Q)) --> delta(bm(Q) - bm(K)), quad quad &"rank"(bm(K)) &= N& "almost surely",
  $
  for some $bm(K) in bb(R)^(N times N)$ to be derived, causing the mixture to collapse to a single Gaussian and thus completing the transition to a Gaussian process with kernel $bm(K)$.
]

=== Expected covariance

While the mixture @eq:uprime-mix has no closed form for finite $H$, progress can be made by computing its mean and covariance:
$
  bb(E)[bm(u')]
  &= bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c))[bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b),bm(c))[bm(u')]]
  = bm(0), \
  bb(E)[bm(u') bm(u')^top]
  &= bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c))[bb(E)_(bm(a)|bm(b),bm(c))[bm(u') bm(u')^top]]
  = sigma_a^2 bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c))[bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top].
$ <eq:covexpval>
Define the _expected covariance_
$
  bm(K) &= bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c))[bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top] in bb(R)^(N times N)
$
Then we obtain elementwise for $bm(K)$:
$
  [bm(K)]_(n m)
  &= bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c)) [sum_(h=1)^H phi.alt_h (t_n) phi.alt_h (t_m)]
$
where $phi.alt_h (t) = (c_h t - b_h)_+^d $ for the neural network model $u'_"NN" (t)$ was defined in @eq:nnphi.
Since the $phi.alt_h (t)$ are statistically equivalent under i.i.d. priors like @eq:priorbc, define a single "mother wavelet" without index $h$ as
$
  phi.alt(t\; b, c) = (c t - b)_+^d, &quad b ~ mono("Normal")(0, sigma_b^2), quad c ~ mono("Normal")(0, sigma_c^2).
$ <eq:motherwavelet>
so the elements of $bm(Phi) bm(Phi)^top$ become sums of $H$ i.i.d. random variables, and their expectation $bm(K)$ factorizes across $h$:
$
  [bm(K)]_(n m)
  &= sum_(h=1)^H bb(E)_(bm(b),bm(c)) [phi.alt_h (t_n) phi.alt_h (t_m)] \
  &= sum_(h=1)^H bb(E)_(b, c) [phi.alt(t_n\; b, c) phi.alt(t_m\; b, c)] \
  &= H thin bb(E)_(b,c) [phi.alt(t_n\; b, c) phi.alt(t_m\; b, c)] \
  &= H thin k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t_n, t_m).
$
We have defined the _temporal arc cosine kernel_ of degree $d$ as
$
  k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t, t')
  &:= bb(E)_(b,c) [phi.alt(t\; b, c) phi.alt(t'\; b, c)] \
  &equiv integral phi.alt(t\; bm(w)) phi.alt(t'\; bm(w)) mono("Normal")(bm(w) | bm(0), bm(Sigma)) dif bm(w),
$ <eq:tack-e>
where $bm(Sigma) = mat(sigma_b^2, 0; 0, sigma_c^2)$ describes the covariance of the hidden weights $bm(w) = (-b, c)^top$.

To recapitulate, the first and second central moments of the mixture @eq:uprime-mix are known:
$
  bb(E)[bm(u')]
  &= bm(0), \
  bb(E)[bm(u') bm(u')^top]
  &= sigma_a^2 bm(K) = sigma_a^2 thin H thin k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t, t').
$
The third, fourth, ... central moments are in general nonzero and difficult to compute.
They will vanish, however, when $H -> oo$.
At this point we have shown that even before taking any limit, the _expected structure_ of the prior already mirrors that of a kernel regression model.
Note that this result hinges critically on the independence assumption for ${b_h, c_h}$ in @eq:motherwavelet.
The closure-constrained prior of @eq:ccbmu would couple these parameters nonlinearly, destroying that independence and making the derivation intractable, which is why we temporarily set it aside.

=== The temporal arc cosine kernel
<sec:temporal-ack>

Of course, I would not have the courage to attempt this whole calculation had I not already known that a very similar limit has been evaluated succesfully in the neural network Gaussian process literature. 
The marginalization we performed above is, in fact, a one-dimensional variant of the classic infinite-width limit of feedforward networks studied by #pcite(<Neal1996>) #pcite(<Williams1998>) and later generalized by #pcite(<Cho2009>). 

In these works, the expectation over random weights $bm(w)$ with $mono("Normal")(bm(w) | bm(0), bm(Sigma))$ priors gives rise to a family of kernels which describe an infinitely wide Bayesian network,
and which differ only with respect to the activation function used and the imposed a priori covariance $bm(Sigma)$.
This same reasoning will now allow us to identify our expected covariance @eq:tack-e with a time-domain specialization of the degree-$d$ arc cosine family.

@table:acks organizes the three kernels we will introduce shortly.
Note that to save on mathematical symbols we use a trick from programming languages: we overload the $k^((d))$ symbol to change meaning based on the type of its arguments. // which we already do with probability p()

    *Arc cosine kernels* of order $d$ introduced in this section.

    The TACK and STACK are simple modifications of ACK for 1D time series.
  ],
) <table:acks>

==== The arc cosine kernel (ACK)
of degree $d$ proposed by #pcite(<Cho2009>) is defined as the expected inner product between infinite-dimensional random RePU features of $D$-dimensional inputs $bm(x), bm(x') in bb(R)^D$:
$
  k^((d)) (bm(x), bm(x')) 
  = 2 integral (bm(w)^top bm(x))_+^d (bm(w)^top bm(x'))_+^d 
    mono("Normal")(bm(w) | bm(0), bm(I)_D) dif bm(w),
$
where the hidden weights $bm(w) in R^D$, and $bm(I)_D$ is the $D times D$ identity matrix.
This integral representation makes it clear that this is indeed a valid positive definite kernel in any input dimension $D >= 1$.
It admits a beautiful closed form:
$
  k^((d)) (bm(x), bm(x')) 
  = 1/pi ||bm(x)||^d ||bm(x')||^d J_d (theta),
$ <eq:ack>
where
$
  theta = arccos ((bm(x)^top bm(x'))/(||bm(x)|| ||bm(x')||)) in [0, pi]
$
is the positive angle between $bm(x)$ and $bm(x')$, and $J_d (theta)$ is given by #pcite(<Cho2009>, supplement: [Eq.~4]) as the generator expression
$
  J_d (theta) = (-1)^d (sin theta)^(2d + 1)
  ( 1 / (sin theta) dif/(dif theta) )^d
  ( (pi - theta) / (sin theta) ).
$
The first few instances are
$
  J_0(theta) & = pi - theta, \
  J_1(theta) & = sin theta + (pi - theta) cos theta, \
  J_2(theta) & = 3 sin theta cos theta + (pi - theta)(1 + 2 cos^2 theta), \
  J_3(theta) & = 15 sin theta - 11 sin^3 theta + (pi - theta)(9 cos theta + 6 cos^3 theta).
$
Compared to the familiar MatÃ©rn kernels, the ACK is a rather atypical kernel, and probably only sparingly used in machine learning applications.
It is, for one, blatantly nonstationary, and it neatly separates the magnitude and angular dependencies of the inner product -- unlike, for example, the RBF kernel.
The closed form @eq:ack shows that the integral representation decomposes as the product of a polynomial factor $||bm(x)||^d ||bm(x')||^d$, which controls the overall scale or dynamic range, and an angular factor $J_d (theta)$, which captures the nonlinear thresholding effect of the RePU activation.

==== The temporal arc cosine kernel (TACK)
is the kernel which describes $bb(E)[bm(u') bm(u')^top]$.
We can cast it as an affine shift of the bias augmented ACK on the input dimension $D = 2$.
Define the auxiliary vectors
$
  bm(x)_t = vec(1, t), quad
  bm(w) = vec(-b, c).
$
and the covariance matrix for the hidden weights ${b, c}$
$
  bm(Sigma) = mat(sigma_b^2, 0; 0, sigma_c^2).
$
Then, by substituting these into @eq:ack and integrating with respect to the Gaussian weight prior $mono("Normal")(bm(w) | bm(0), bm(Sigma))$, we obtain the TACK:
$
  k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t, t')
  &= bb(E)_(b,c) [phi.alt(t\; b, c) phi.alt(t'\; b, c)] \
  &= integral (bm(w)^top bm(x)_t)_+^d (bm(w)^top bm(x)_t')_+^d 
     mono("Normal")(bm(w) | bm(0), bm(Sigma)) dif bm(w) \
  &= 1/2 thin k^((d)) (bm(Sigma)^(1/2) bm(x)_t, bm(Sigma)^(1/2) bm(x)_t') \
  &= 1/(2pi) ||bm(Sigma)^(1/2) bm(x)_t||^d ||bm(Sigma)^(1/2) bm(x)_t'||^d J_d (theta),
$ <eq:tack>
where the factor $1\/2$ follows from the Heaviside convention used in #pcite(<Cho2009>).
Here,
$
  theta = arccos((bm(x)_t^top bm(Sigma) bm(x)_t')/
          (sqrt(bm(x)_t^top bm(Sigma) bm(x)_t) sqrt(bm(x)_t'^top bm(Sigma) bm(x)_t'))),
$
is the angle between $bm(x)_t$ and $bm(x)_t'$ in the geometry induced by $bm(Sigma)$.
This anisotropic variant was also used in the context of $D $-dimensional feature extraction by #pcite(<Pandey2014>).

==== The standard temporal arc cosine kernel (STACK)
simplifies the TACK with the particular choice
$bm(Sigma) := bm(I)_2$, which yields
$
  k^((d)) (t, t')
  &â¡ k^((d))_bm(I)_2 (t, t') \
  &= 1/(2pi) (1+t^2)^(d/2) (1+t'^2)^(d/2) J_d (theta),
$ <eq:stack>
where
$
  theta = arccos ((1 + t t')/(sqrt(1 + t^2) sqrt(1 + t'^2))).
$
/*
Unlike in the original derivation of @Williams1998, we do not require the hidden-unit activation $(c t - b)_+^d$ to be bounded.
It is sufficient that its output has finite variance under the Gaussian weight prior, as shown by @Matthews2018.
For $(c t - b)_+^d$ with $b, c ~ N(0, sigma^2)$, this condition holds for any finite degree $d$ and time $t$, 
so the infinite-width limit indeed yields the degree-$d$ arc-cosine kernel of @Cho2009.
*/

=== From expectation to convergence

From @eq:Q-push-forward
$
  bm(Q) = sigma_a^2 sum_(h=1)^H phi.alt_h (t_n) phi.alt_h (t_m).
$
Its expected value scales as $H$:
$
  bb(E)_(bm(b), bm(c))[bm(Q)] = sigma_a^2 bm(K) = sigma_a^2 thin H thin k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t_n, t_m)
$ <eq:scales-as-H>
Since we will let $H$ be unbounded, we renormalize $sigma_a -> sigma_a^* = sigma_a \/ sqrt(H)$ such that
$
  bm(Q) -> bm(Q)^* = sigma_a^2/H sum_(h=1)^H phi.alt_h (t_n) phi.alt_h (t_m)
$
Observe that this is a Monte Carlo estimate of the scaled TACK $sigma_a^2 k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t_n, t_m)$ by @eq:scales-as-H.
Therefore, by the strong law of large numbers we conclude that
$
  bm(Q)^* -> bb(E)_(bm(b), bm(c))[bm(Q)^*] = sigma_a^2 k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t_n, t_m) quad quad "as" H -> oo.
$
Equivalently, the induced density $p_H(bm(Q))$ of covariance matrices collapses weakly to a Dirac delta at $bm(K)$:
$
  p_H(bm(Q)) --> delta(bm(Q) - bm(K)).
$
/*
$
  bb(E)_(bm(b), bm(c))[bm(Q)] -> sigma_a^2 thin k^((d))_bm(Sigma) (t_n, t_m)
$
*/

///////////////////////

/*
So far we have shown that the _expectation_ of the data-space covariance equals $H bm(K)$.
But for a _single_ random draw of ${bm(b), bm(c)}$, the empirical covariance is, from @eq:Q-push-forward,
$
  bm(Q)_H = sum_(h=1)^H bm(v)_h bm(v)_h^top,
  quad [bm(v)_h]_n = (c_h t_n - b_h)_+^d,
$
still fluctuates around its expectation with elementwise variance of $O(H)$.
Increasing $H$ without rescaling merely amplifies these fluctuations.
To reach a well-defined infinite-width limit we must therefore normalize the model.

Dividing the summation in @eq:uNN by $sqrt(H)$ gives the normalized version
$
  u'_"NN" (t)
  = 1/sqrt(H) sum_(h=1)^H a_h (c_h t - b_h)_+^d,
$
which induces the corresponding normalized covariance
$
  bm(Q)_H = 1/H sum_(h=1)^H bm(v)_h bm(v)_h^top.
$
Its expectation is now constant,
$
  bb(E)[bm(Q)_H] = bm(K),
$
and by the strong law of large numbers each matrix element converges almost surely:
$
  [bm(Q)_H]_(n m)
  = 1/H sum_(h=1)^H (c_h t_n - b_h)_+^d (c_h t_m - b_h)_+^d
  -> bb(E)_(b,c) [(c t_n - b)_+^d (c t_m - b)_+^d]
  = [bm(K)]_(n m).
$
Equivalently, the induced density $p_H(bm(Q))$ of covariance matrices collapses weakly to a Dirac delta at $bm(K)$:
$
  p_H(bm(Q)) --> delta(bm(Q) - bm(K)).
$

*/

=== The Gaussian-process limit

Because $bm(u')$ is conditionally Gaussian given $bm(Q)_H$, the full marginal is a mixture
$
  p(bm(u'))
  = integral mono("Normal")(bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(Q)) thin p_H(bm(Q)) dif bm(Q).
$
As $H -> oo$, the measure $p_H(bm(Q))$ collapses and the integral reduces to a single Gaussian:
$
  p(bm(u')) -> mono("Normal")(bm(0), sigma_a^2 bm(K)).
$
In other words, not only the expectation of the covariance but the entire _law_ of $bm(u')$ converges to that of a Gaussian.
All higher central moments vanish as $O(1/sqrt(H))$ because the covariance fluctuations themselves decay at that rate.
Since this argument holds for any finite collection of times ${t_1, dots, t_N}$, the limiting process is a Gaussian process

The function family thereby reaches full rank in data space and becomes nonparametric.
The hyperparameters $(sigma_a, sigma_b, sigma_c, d)$ retain their familiar roles:
overall scale, typical changepoint location, horizontal stretch, and polynomial order.
In @chapter:pack we will reincorporate the closure constraint into this process.

In summary, the path mirrors the classical data-space derivation of Gaussian processes.
For fixed $(bm(b), bm(c))$ the prior on $bm(u')$ is Gaussian with low-rank covariance.
Marginalizing over $(bm(b), bm(c))$ produces a Gaussian mixture.
As $H$ increases, the empirical covariance $bm(Q)_H$ converges to its population mean $bm(K)$, the mixture integral collapses, and the limit is a single Gaussian with covariance $sigma_a^2 bm(K)$.
Equivalently, the function prior converges to a Gaussian process with kernel /*@eq:kdsigma-final*/ over the open phase.
The hyperparameters $(sigma_a, sigma_b, sigma_c, d)$ retain their roles as output scale, typical hinge location, horizontal stretch, and polynomial sharpness.
We will fold the closed phase and the closure constraint back into this process in @chapter:pack.


/*
This is the exact finite case analogue of the GP: nonparametric, so infinite rank: support everywhere
but priors on the amplitudes determine where on the hyperplane we can reach, and this in GP land is projected as the "kernel character": how smooth, stationary, etc.
Interestingly, when projecting the GP back to the reduced rank case, again a linear model is found and the amplitudes again determine the character to great extent, encoding properties like closure constraint, differentiability, and spectral properties.

/*
Averaging also over $(bm(b), bm(c))$ converts the finite sum into a Monte Carlo estimate of a kernel integral:
$
  E_(bm(b), bm(c))[Q_(n n')]
  = H sigma_a^2 E_(b, c)[phi.alt (t_n; b, c) phi.alt (t_{n'}; b, c)].
$
Hence each additional hidden unit adds another sample from the same base measure, refining the empirical estimate of the kernel.
Writing
$
  K_d (t, t') = E_(b, c)[phi.alt (t\; b, c) phi.alt (t'; b, c)]
  = [0 < t <= t_c][0 < t' <= t_c] E_(b, c)[(c t - b)_+^d (c t' - b)_+^d],
$
we have
$
  E_(bm(w))[Q_(n n')] = H sigma_a^2 K_d (t_n, t_{n'}).
$

To keep variance finite as $H$ grows, set $sigma_a^2 = sigma^2 / H$.
Then
$
  E_(bm(w))[Q_(n n')] -> sigma^2 K_d (t_n, t_{n'}),
$
and the finite sum becomes a Monte Carlo quadrature of the kernel integral in expectation.
As $H -> oo$, the empirical measure $(1/H) sum_h delta_(b_h, c_h)$ converges to its generating distribution, so the random-feature model converges in distribution to a Gaussian process
$
  lim_(H -> oo) u'_H(t) ~ mono("Gaussian process")(0, sigma^2 K_d (t, t')).
$

The base measure for $(b, c)$ determines the shape of $K_d$.
Taking $(b, c) ~ mono("Normal")((0, 0), "diag"(sigma_b^2, sigma_c^2))$ maximizes entropy given fixed second moments and admits a closed form.
Defining augmented variables
$
  tilde(w) = (c, -b), quad tilde(x) = (t, 1),
$
we can write $phi.alt (t\; b, c) = (tilde(w)^top tilde(x))_+^d$.
Under the Gaussian base measure for $tilde(w)$ this becomes the *degree-$d$ arc-cosine kernel* of #pcite(<Cho2009>):
$
  K_d(t, t') = [0 < t <= t_c][0 < t' <= t_c] k_d (tilde(x), tilde(x')).

=== Comments
We now discuss some aspects of the solution @eq:kgfm in greater detail.
This Section can be safely skipped.


==== What happened?
It is worth pausing to ask what really happened here.
At first sight, taking $H -> oo$ might seem like an act of reckless generalization: we blow up the number of parameters without bound, yet somehow end up with something *simpler*âa single Gaussian process with a fixed kernel. Conditional on the random features, the model was already Gaussian, so the only effect of the limit is that the *random design itself* stops being random. The empirical kernel freezes to its mean, and with it the whole architecture of the network becomes a static, deterministic map from inputs to covariances.

This is the peculiar balance of the Gaussian process limit. The randomness of finite networks (the accident of which features you drew) disappears, while the *expressive field* of possible functions becomes infinite. What looks like a loss of freedom in one space is a gain of freedom in another. You trade a random, high-dimensional parameterization for a deterministic law over an infinite-dimensional function space. The model collapses in its parameter dimension but expands in its functional reach. That is the sense in which the GP limit achieves âinfinite resolutionâ: it no longer needs to enumerate features to approximate every smooth behavior the kernel supports. The prior already spans that continuum.

This connects directly to the remark by MacKay (1998) about âthrowing out the baby with the bathwater.â
MacKay warned that when one marginalizes out parameters too earlyâwhen one keeps only the covariance structure and discards the explicit representation of weightsâone may lose intuition about how learning actually works. In our case, the GP limit *is* that marginalization, pushed to its logical extreme. The baby (the random feature machinery) is gone, but its bathwaterâthe covariance it left behindâturns out to be everything. The Gaussian process is the distilled trace of that infinite hidden layer, the residual law that remains once we have averaged over all its possible microscopic configurations. The cost is that we can no longer âseeâ the mechanism that created a particular function; the benefit is that the resulting prior is perfectly well-defined, smooth, and tractable.

So the infinite-width limit does not so much simplify the neural network as *clarify* it: by letting the networkâs structural noise disappear, it reveals the underlying stochastic law that every large random feature model was already approximating in miniature.

==== Infinite precision?
In this view, increasing $H$ increases the _Monte Carlo resolution_ with which the regression model samples its feature space.
The nonparametric limit replaces explicit random changepoints with their continuous Gaussian measure, yielding a Gaussian process prior over $u'(t)$ whose covariance is the arc-cosine kernel restricted to the open phase of the glottal cycle.

There is a caveat however; we got "infinite" precision (meaning full rank), but smoother functions.
This is the analogue of the amplitude prior of footnote 17 which constrains the ellipsoid.


/* main point here: YES, we compromised; we got fast inference, but also diminshed support for true O(1) amount of jumps like a Levy process would. This is a practical question -- need to find out by running nested sampling and see how much support for these jumps is really there -- just calculate! */

/* This means we should model u(t), not du(t)!

u(t) ~ arccos: arccos is always continuous -- we cant do real jumps

but if we can get du(t) implicitly -- from spectral domain OR via AR pole -- we can maybe cheat this thing

Maybe we can LEARN the radiation characteristic by priming our AR prior to look for that spectral decay of +6db/oct

So we model u(t) * (h(t) * r(t)) and the latter factor of combined VT + radiation impulse response is learned directly

another option is to integrate data (move diff to data) but this possibly nasty

pre-emphasis just flattens spectral slope as to partition poles better -- has nothing to do with radiation factor.
Radition factor can only be undone by integrating, not further diffing.
Pre-emphasis tilts the spectrum "up" by emphasizing higher freqs and is a fitting trick

On the other hand
LPC just proclaims s(t) = e(t) * h(t) and shoves radiation into the source such that h(t) cna remain all-pole
since differentiation is ~ i2pi x => zero, not a pole
so we are generalizing LPC, so also choose e(t) => u(t) * r(t)

==== Why not go infinite depth?
Different character from increasing width; effective depth of deep GPs. If stable limit, it becomes independent of inputs @Diaconis1999. Seen often in DGPs as input independency, "forgetting inputs". Though one might counteract that going to infinite width also has similar "unfortunate" consequences (MacKay's baby with the bath water): "features are not learned", basis functions are fixed. This shows that kernel hyperparameters must encode (most of) features. We do this via sparse multiple kernel learning; ie static kernels on the Yoshii-grid mechanism; our hyperparams are $(T, tau, "OQ")$, ie 3 dim grid.

==== Why not spline models?
Piecewise spline models are well-known and effective in low-dimensional nonparametric regression. Why not use them? Because they depend on the resolution. As Gaussian process priors, spline kernels produce posterior means that are splines with knots (hingepoints in some derivative) fixed at the observed inputs and nowhere else @MacKay1998[p. 6]. In contrast, the $arccos(n)$ kernel will learn the effective number of hingepoints from the data, which may happily remain $O(1)$ while the amount of datapoints grows indefinitely. Translated to our problem, we want the number of effective change points to be resolution-independent (independent of the sampling frequency) and not confined to the observation locations.

==== Why not LÃ©vy processes?
These encode Poisson-style jumps $O(1)$ in number in time. But inference in these is always $O("# of jumps")$. So can't really marginalize out these jump points, and we want to avoid MCMC. We want to stack everything in the amplitude marginalization. But, actual discontinuities require LÃ©vy processes; the arc cosine GP alone can only fake it with steep ramps /*(see @fig:steep)*/.

== Summary

We showed that nonparametric piecewise polynomials are feasible. 
they correspond to an Infinite width neural network

this is a well known limit which we repurposed for GIF to make the bridge between parametric (joint source-filter estimation) and nonparametric methods (based on filtering without a parametric)

we took great care in this chapter to make that conceptual leap as clear as possible

==== How good of a GFM is this still?
After all this surgical changes to basic GFMs we run through our checklist to see if this still can a priori represent what we need: the glottal cycle! @fig:glottal-cycle

// maybe put this in summary

Before doing so, we take a look at how much of viable candidates @eq:udH still are as GFMs.

Differentiable: yes

Domain: yes

No return phase unless very lucky, tiny support

Closure constraint: we could restrict this analytically

Putting priors will enable us to trace out a family of GFMs
