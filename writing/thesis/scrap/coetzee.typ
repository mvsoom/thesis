// Shows the need of Bayesian probability to take center stage

J.M. Coetzee on his acceptance speech:

> My word of advice is this. That the anti-scientific movement is not made up solely of stupid, benighted people who have fallen prey to nonsensical conspiracy theories. It includes intelligent people who find the self-certainty, the lack of humility, of the typical scientific mindset troubling. In particular, they have trouble understanding scientific predictions based on probability.

> If the temperature rises by 1.5 degrees there is a 90% probability that the sea level will rise by a metre, say the scientists. Ordinary people don’t understand statements like these – not really, not in their full ramifications. When they are in a cynical mood, people say that couching promises and predictions in terms of probabilities is simply science’s escape clause, its way of ensuring that the scientist is never wrong.

> We throw the word probable around easily, it is part of our everyday language; but probability is actually a difficult concept, even for philosophers. Practitioners of the sciences, including the social sciences, who rely heavily on the mathematics of probability as a way of talking about the future, should think hard about what probability means in their practice and find ways of explaining their practice in a way that ordinary people can understand. Much is at stake in the present intellectual and political climate, not least the standing of science in the eyes of the public, and the reputation of the modern university

I believe the answer to this question was given 250 years earlier by Laplace:

> Prob n'est la common sense reduite au ...

There _is_ a unique answer to the meaning of it all.
And thinkers in the line of Jeffreys, Jaynes, MacKay, Skilling have advanced and "debugged" this thinking to where it stands today.

Consumers are experiencing probability in a very concrete way: in pressing "Retry" for LLM/image/song generative models.
After all these models calculate conditional probability distributions.
Science needs to catch up too.

This is the backdrop behind the techniques employed in this thesis.
Prob theory is just cost management; a sort of bookkeeping; one assigns costs at the beginning of an inference and prob calculus makes sure that these are "followed through" through the calculation.
Even though the calculations might seem complicated, probability theory, assuming our approximations did their job well, will guarantee that our initial costs are "seen through" correctly.
In this way it is a "black-box" algorithm in the best possible way: interpret your priors and don't worry after; in this way we justify our error bars.
