  abstract = {The stochastic block model (SBM) is a random graph model with planted clusters. It is widely employed as a canonical model to study clustering and community detection, and provides generally a fertile ground to study the statistical and computational tradeoffs that arise in network and data sciences. This note surveys the recent developments that establish the fundamental limits for community detection in the SBM, both with respect to information-theoretic and computational thresholds, and for various recovery requirements such as exact, partial and weak recovery (a.k.a., detection). The main results discussed are the phase transitions for exact recovery at the Chernoff-Hellinger threshold, the phase transition for weak recovery at the Kesten-Stigum threshold, the optimal distortion-SNR tradeoff for partial recovery, the learning of the SBM parameters and the gap between information-theoretic and computational thresholds. The note also covers some of the algorithms developed in the quest of achieving the limits, in particular two-round algorithms via graph-splitting, semi-definite programming, linearized belief propagation, classical and nonbacktracking spectral methods. A few open problems are also discussed.},

Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current ``run,'' or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

It is motivated by machine learning applications for high-consequence engineering systems, where this kind of information is often made available from phenomenological knowledge. We consider a GP \$f\$ over functions on \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{X\} {\textbackslash}subset {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{n\}\$ taking values in \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$, where the process \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}f\$ is still Gaussian when \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\$ is a linear operator. Our goal is to model \$f\$ under the constraint that realizations of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}f\$ are confined to a convex set of functions. In particular, we require that \$a {\textbackslash}leq {\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}f {\textbackslash}leq b\$, given two functions \$a\$ and \$b\$ where \$a {$<$} b\$ pointwise. This formulation provides a consistent way of encoding multiple linear constraints, such as shape-constraints based on e.g. boundedness, monotonicity or convexity. We adopt the approach of using a sufficiently dense set of virtual observation locations where the constraint is required to hold, and derive the exact posterior for a conjugate likelihood. The results needed for stable numerical implementation are derived, together with an efficient sampling scheme for estimating the posterior process.},

The proposed quasi closed phase (QCP) analysis method utilizes weighted linear prediction (WLP) with a specific attenuated main excitation (AME) weight function that attenuates the contribution of the glottal source in the linear prediction model optimization. This enables the use of the autocorrelation criterion in linear prediction in contrast to the covariance criterion used in conventional closed phase analysis. The QCP method was compared to previously developed methods by using synthetic vowels produced with the conventional source-filter model as well as with a physical modeling approach. The obtained objective measures show that the QCP method improves the GIF performance in terms of errors in typical glottal source parametrizations for both low- and high-pitched vowels. Additionally, QCP was tested in a physiologically oriented vocoder, where the analysis/synthesis quality was evaluated with a subjective listening test indicating improved perceived quality for normal speaking style.},

The method aims to jointly model the effect of vocal tract and lip radiation with a single filter whose coefficients are optimized using QPR. This optimization is based on the principles of closed phase analysis, where the contribution of the glottal source is attenuated in optimizing the inverse model of the vocal tract. By expressing the optimization problem in terms of the output of a filter, we can apply physically motivated optimization such as flatness of the closed phase. The proposed method was objectively evaluated using a synthetic Liljencrants-Fant model based test set of sustained vowels, as well as a real speech test set where the glottal flow estimates' closed phases were compared in terms of their flatness. The results based on synthetic speech indicate that the proposed method is robust to changes in f0, and state-of-the-art quality results were obtained for high-pitched voices, when f0 is in the range 330-450 Hz. The results based on real speech indicate that the proposed method produces glottal flow estimates that have flatter closed phases with less formant ripple in comparison to estimates computed with known reference methods.},

During the financial crisis, the interest rates are found to be substantially below indicative quotes of interest rates provided by major banks. Our econometric model attributes the interest rate variation partly to differences in banks' characteristics including relative size and connectedness, implying favorable terms for banks of systemic importance. Moreover, interest rates are found to depend not only on overall liquidity in the interbank market, but possibly on its distribution among banks as well, suggesting exploitation of market power by banks with surplus liquidity. There is also evidence of stronger effects on interest rates of systemic importance, credit ratings and liquidity demand and supply since the start of the current financial crisis.

For example, relatively simple organisms grow, persist and reproduce despite drastic pharmaceutical or environmental interventions, an error tolerance attributed to the robustness of the underlying metabolic network. Complex communication networks display a surprising degree of robustness: although key components regularly malfunction, local failures rarely lead to the loss of the global information-carrying ability of the network. The stability of these and other complex systems is often attributed to the redundant wiring of the functional web defined by the systems' components. Here we demonstrate that error tolerance is not shared by all redundant systems: it is displayed only by a class of inhomogeneously wired networks, called scale-free networks, which include the \{World-Wide\} Web, the Internet, social networks and cells. We find that such networks display an unexpected degree of robustness, the ability of their nodes to communicate being unaffected even by unrealistically high failure rates. However, error tolerance comes at a high price in that these networks are extremely vulnerable to attacks (that is, to the selection and removal of a few nodes that play a vital role in maintaining the network's connectivity). Such error tolerance and attack vulnerability are generic properties of communication networks},

The approach is applicable to a wide range of data from physical measurements and numerical simulations. It is based on the well-known invariance of the Gaussian under linear operators, in particular differentiation. Instead of using a generic covariance function to represent data from an unknown field, the space of possible covariance functions is restricted to allow only Gaussian random fields that fulfil the homogeneous differential equation. The resulting tailored kernel functions lead to more reliable regression compared to using a generic kernel and makes some hyperparameters directly interpretable. For differential equations representing laws of physics such a choice limits realizations of random fields to physically possible solutions. Source terms are added by superposition and their strength estimated in a probabilistic fashion, together with possibly unknown hyperparameters with physical meaning in the differential operator.},

Due to its computational complexity and long-running nature, in the past, nested sampling has been reserved for offline-type Bayesian inference, leaving tools such as variational inference and MCMC for online-type, time-constrained, Bayesian computations. These tools do not easily handle complicated multi-modal posteriors, discrete random variables, and posteriors lacking gradients, nor do they enable practical calculations of the Bayesian evidence. An opening thus remains for a high-performance out-of-the-box nested sampling package that can close the gap in computational time, and let nested sampling become common place in the data science toolbox. We present JAX-based nested sampling (JAXNS), a high-performance nested sampling package written in XLA-primitives using JAX, and show that it is several orders of magnitude faster than the currently available nested sampling implementations of PolyChord, MultiNEST, and dynesty, while maintaining the same accuracy of evidence calculation.

In higher dimensions, Nested Sampling relies on Markov Chain-based likelihood-constrained prior samplers, which generate numerous 'phantom points' during parameter space exploration. These points are too auto-correlated to be used in the standard Nested Sampling scheme and so are conventionally discarded, leading to waste. Our approach discovers a way to integrate these phantom points into the evidence calculation, thereby improving the efficiency of Nested Sampling without sacrificing accuracy. This is achieved by ensuring the points within the live set remain asymptotically i.i.d. uniformly distributed, allowing these points to contribute meaningfully to the final evidence estimation. We apply our method on several models, demonstrating substantial enhancements in sampling efficiency, that scales well in high-dimension. Our findings suggest that this approach can reduce the number of required likelihood evaluations by at least a factor of 5. This advancement holds considerable promise for improving the robustness and speed of statistical analyses over a wide range of fields, from astrophysics and cosmology to climate modelling.},

The common process to create such synthetic datasets is to implement small scripts or programs, restricted to small problems or to a specific application. In this paper we propose a framework designed to generate high dimensional datasets. Users can interactively create and navigate through multi dimensional datasets using a suitable graphical user-interface. The data creation is driven by statistical distributions based on a few user-defined parameters. First, a grounding dataset is created according to given inputs, and then structures and trends are included in selected dimensions and orthogonal projection planes. Furthermore, our framework supports the creation of complex non-orthogonal trends and classified datasets. It can successfully be used to create synthetic datasets simulating important trends as multidimensional clusters, correlations and outliers.},

  abstract = {A new glottal wave analysis method, Pitch Synchronous lterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (PSIAIF) is presented. The algorithm is based on a previously developed method, Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF). In the IAIF-method the glottal contribution to the speech spectrum is first estimated with an iterative structure. The vocal tract transfer function is modeled after eliminating the average glottal contribution. The glottal excitation is obtained by cancelling the effects of the vocal tract and lip radiation by inverse filtering. In the new PSIAIF-method the glottal pulseform is computed by applying the IAIF-algorithm twice to the same signal. The first IAIF-analysis gives as a result a glottal excitation that spans over several pitch periods. This pulseform is used in order to determine positions and lengths of frames for the pitch synchronous analysis. The final result is obtained by analysing the original speech signal with the IAIF-algorithm one fundamental period at a time. The PSlAIF-algorithm was applied in glottal wave analysis using both synthetic and natural vowels.

  abstract = {\emph{Objective:} The goal of the study is to use physical modelling of voice production to assess the performance of an inverse filtering method in estimating the glottal flow from acoustic speech pressure signals. \emph{Methods:} An automatic inverse filtering method is presented, and speech pressure signals are generated using physical modelling of voice production so as to obtain test vowels with a known shape of the glottal excitation waveform. The speech sounds produced consist of 4 different vowels, each with 10 different values of the fundamental frequency. Both the original glottal flows given by physical modelling and their estimates computed by inverse filtering were parametrised with two robust voice source parameters: the normalized amplitude quotient and the difference (in decibels) between the levels of the first and second harmonics. \emph{Results:}The results show that for both extracted parameters the error introduced by inverse filtering was, in general, small. The effect of the distortion caused by inverse filtering on the parameter values was clearly smaller than the change in the corresponding parameters when the phonation type was altered. The distortion was largest for high-pitched vowels with the lowest value of the first formant. \emph{Conclusions:} The study shows that the proposed inverse filtering technique combined with the extracted parameters constitutes a voice source analysis tool that is able to measure the voice source dynamics automatically with satisfactory accuracy.},

  abstract = {Glottal inverse filtering (GIF) refers to technology to estimate the source of voiced speech, the glottal flow, from speech signals. When a new GIF algorithm is proposed, its accuracy needs to be evaluated. However, the evaluation of GIF is problematic because the ground truth, the real glottal volume velocity signal generated by the vocal folds, cannot be recorded non-invasively from natural speech. This absence of the ground truth has been circumvented in most previous GIF studies by using simple linear source-filter synthesis techniques with known artificial glottal flow models and all-pole vocal tract filters. Moreover, in a few previous studies, physical modeling of speech production has been utilized in synthesis of the test data for GIF evaluation. The evaluation strategy in previous GIF studies is, however, scattered between individual investigations and there is currently a lack of a coherent, common platform to be used in GIF evaluation. In order to address this shortcoming, the current study introduces a new environment, called OPENGLOT, for GIF evaluation. The key ideas of OPENGLOT are twofold: the environment is versatile (i.e., it provides different types of test signals for GIF evaluation) and open (i.e., the system can be used by anyone who wants to evaluate her or his new GIF method and compare it objectively to previously developed benchmark techniques). OPENGLOT consists of four main parts, Repositories I--IV, that contain data and sound synthesis software. Repository I contains a large set of synthetic glottal flow waveforms, and speech signals generated by using the Liljencrants--Fant (LF) waveform as an artificial excitation, and a digital all-pole filter to model the vocal tract. Repository II contains glottal flow and speech pressure signals generated using physical modeling of human speech production. Repository III contains pairs of glottal excitation and speech pressure signal generated by exciting 3D printed plastic vocal tract replica with LF excitations via a loudspeaker. Finally, Repository IV contains multichannel recordings (speech pressure signal, electroglottogram, high-speed video of the vocal folds) from natural production of speech. After presenting these four core parts of OPENGLOT, the article demonstrates the platform by presenting a typical use case.},

One technical obstacle to using nested sampling in practice is the requirement (for most common implementations) that prior distributions be provided in the form of transformations from the unit hyper-cube to the target prior density. For many applications - particularly when using the posterior from one experiment as the prior for another - such a transformation is not readily available. In this letter we show that parametric bijectors trained on samples from a desired prior density provide a general-purpose method for constructing transformations from the uniform base density to a target prior, enabling the practical use of nested sampling under arbitrary priors. We demonstrate the use of trained bijectors in conjunction with nested sampling on a number of examples from cosmology.},

Prior information about the underlying physical mechanisms by which sounds are generated and rules by which complex sound structure is constructed (notes, chords, a complete musical score), can be naturally unified using Bayesian modelling techniques. Typically algorithms for Automatic Music Transcription independently carry out individual tasks such as multiple-F0 detection and beat tracking. The challenge remains to perform joint estimation of all parameters. We present a Bayesian approach for modelling music audio, and content analysis. The proposed methodology based on Gaussian processes seeks joint estimation of multiple music concepts by incorporating into the kernel prior information about non-stationary behaviour, dynamics, and rich spectral content present in the modelled music signal. We illustrate the benefits of this approach via two tasks: pitch estimation, and inferring missing segments in a polyphonic audio recording.},

As a result, source separation GP models have been restricted to the analysis of short audio frames. We introduce an efficient application of GPs to time-domain audio source separation, without compromising performance. For this purpose, we used GP regression, together with spectral mixture kernels, and variational sparse GPs. We compared our method with LD-PSDTF (positive semi-definite tensor factorization), KL-NMF (Kullback-Leibler non-negative matrix factorization), and IS-NMF (Itakura-Saito NMF). Results show that the proposed method outperforms these techniques.},

In this paper, we cast the correspondence problem directly as an optimal transport (OT) problem, building on the idea that word embeddings arise from metric recovery algorithms. Indeed, we exploit the GromovWasserstein distance that measures how similarities between pairs of words relate across languages. We show that our OT objective can be estimated efficiently, requires little or no tuning, and results in performance comparable with the state-of-the-art in various unsupervised word translation tasks.},

But in crises, connections can facilitate contagion -- as initial problems lead to chains of defaults and liquidity shortages -- sparked by shocks which might arise within the financial system or from the real economy.{\textbackslash}nInstitutions are also interconnected in indirect ways, since they are exposed to common risk factors that can result in concurrent losses. For example, most banks extend loans secured by real estate: they are thus collectively exposed to falls in house prices. Resulting bank distress can then exacerbate initial problems: banks might simultaneously sell collateral (houses), thus worsening downward price spirals. Less tangibly, institutions can also be connected through perceptions of counterparties' creditworthiness. Given uncertainty, financial institutions may in general become reluctant to lend to each other and hoard liquidity.{\textbackslash}nPotential for contagion due to interconnectedness is a key component of systemic risk. As a first step towards understanding the mechanisms of contagion, this paper abstracts from complex indirect connections between banks, and rather focuses on direct linkages between 53 large EU banks, based on unique data on interbank exposures collected by national regulators as of the end of 2011.},

In this work, state-space methods are investigated to enhance the joint estimation of the glottal source and the vocal tract information. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, a stochastic glottal source is proposed, based on deterministic Liljencrants--Fant model and ruled by a stochastic difference equation. Such a representation allows to accurately capture any perturbation occurring at glottal level in real voices. A state-space voice model is formulated considering the stochastic glottal source. Then, combining this voice model and the state-space framework, an inverse filtering method is developed that allows to jointly estimate both glottal source and vocal tract filter. The performance of this method is studied by means of experiments with voices synthesized by applying both the source-filter theory and a physical based voice model. The method is also test using human voice signals. The results demonstrate that accurate estimates of the glottal source and the vocal tract filter can be obtained over several scenarios. Moreover, the method is shown to be robust with respect to different phonation types.},

In addition to the dynamic glottal resistance, there exists a hypothetical inductance in the equivalent circuit which is mainly responsible for the skewing of the source pulses under load.

An original Bayesian model is proposed that allows us to define a posterior distribution on the parameter space. All Bayesian inference is then based on this distribution. Unfortunately, a direct evaluation of this distribution and of its features, including posterior model probabilities, requires evaluation of some complicated high-dimensional integrals. We develop an efficient stochastic algorithm based on reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to perform the Bayesian computation. A convergence result for this algorithm is established. In simulation, it appears that the performance of detection based on posterior model probabilities outperforms conventional detection schemes.},

This paper proposes a new generative model, a dynamic version of the log-linear topic model of{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}citet\{mnih2007three\}. The methodological novelty is to use the prior to compute closed form expressions for word statistics. This provides a theoretical justification for nonlinear models like PMI, word2vec, and GloVe, as well as some hyperparameter choices. It also helps explain why low-dimensional semantic embeddings contain linear algebraic structure that allows solution of word analogies, as shown by{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}citet\{mikolov2013efficient\} and many subsequent papers. Experimental support is provided for the generative model assumptions, the most important of which is that latent word vectors are fairly uniformly dispersed in space.},

  abstract = {We describe in this paper a method for efficient encoding of speech signals, based on predictive coding. In this coding method, both the transmitter and the receiver estimate the signal's current value by linear prediction on the previously transmitted signal. The difference between this estimate and the true value of the signal is quantized, coded and transmitted to the receiver. At the receiver, the decoded difference signal is added to the predicted signal to reproduce the input speech signal. Because of the nonstationary nature of the speech signals, an adaptive linear predictor is used, which is readjusted periodically to minimize the mean-square error between the predicted and the true value of the signals. The predictive coding system was simulated on a digital computer. The predictor parameters, comprising one delay and nine other coefficients related to the signal spectrum, were readjusted every 5 milliseconds. The speech signal was sampled at a rate of 6.67 kHz, and the difference signal was quantized by a two-level quantizer with variable step size. Subjective comparisons with speech from a logarithmic PCM encoder (log-PCM) indicate that the quality of the synthesized speech signal from the predictive coding system is approximately equal to that of log-PCM speech encoded at 6 bits/sample. Preliminary studies suggest that the binary difference signal and the predictor parameters together can be transmitted at approximately 10 kilobits/second which is several times less than the bit rate required for log-PCM encoding with comparable speech quality.},

This manner of representing excitation requires that speech segments be classified accurately into voiced and unvoiced categories and the pitch period of voiced segments be known. It is now well recognized that such a rigid idealization of the vocal excitation is often responsible for the unnatural quality associated with synthesized speech. This paper describes a new approach to the excitation problem that does not require a priori knowledge of either the voiced-unvoiced decision or the pitch period. All classes of sounds are generated by exciting the LPC filter with a sequence of pulses; the amplitudes and locations of the pulses are determined using a non-iterative analysis-by-synthesis procedure. This procedure minimizes a perceptual-distance metric representing subjectively-important differences between the waveforms of the original and the synthetic speech signals. The distance metric takes account of the finite-frequency resolution as well as the differential sensitivity of the human ear to errors in the formant and inter-formant regions of the speech spectrum.},

This question of applicability carries an important bearing on the potential use of importance sampling for solving dynamic first-excursion problems and static reliability problems for structures with a large number of uncertain structural model parameters. The conditions under which importance sampling is applicable in high dimensions are investigated, where the focus is put on the common case of standard Gaussian uncertain parameters. It is found that importance sampling densities using design points are applicable if the covariance matrix associated with each design point does not deviate significantly from the identity matrix. The study also suggests that importance sampling densities using random pre-samples are generally not applicable in high dimensions.},

First, initial estimates of the vocal tract and glottal flow are evaluated by an existing GIF method, iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF). Simultaneously, the initially estimated glottal flow is synthesized using the Rosenberg--Klatt (RK) model and filtered with the estimated vocal tract filter to create a synthetic speech frame. In the MCMC estimation process, the first few poles of the initial vocal tract model and the RK excitation parameter are refined in order to minimize the error between the synthetic and original speech signals in the time and frequency domain. MCMC approximates the posterior distribution of the parameters, and the final estimate of the vocal tract is found by averaging the parameter values of the Markov chain. Experiments with synthetic vowels produced by a physical modeling approach show that the MCMC-based GIF method gives more accurate results compared to two known reference methods.},

We target model order and parameter estimation via variational inference in a probabilistic model in which the frequencies are continuous-valued, i.e., not restricted to a grid; and the coefficients are governed by a Bernoulli-Gaussian prior model turning model order selection into binary sequence detection. Unlike earlier works which retain only point estimates of the frequencies, we undertake a more complete Bayesian treatment by estimating the posterior probability density functions (pdfs) of the frequencies and computing expectations over them. Thus, we additionally capture and operate with the uncertainty of the frequency estimates. Aiming to maximize the model evidence, variational optimization provides analytic approximations of the posterior pdfs and also gives estimates of the additional parameters. We propose an accurate representation of the pdfs of the frequencies by mixtures of von Mises pdfs, which yields closed-form expectations. We define the algorithm VALSE in which the estimates of the pdfs and parameters are iteratively updated. VALSE is a gridless, convergent method, does not require parameter tuning, can easily include prior knowledge about the frequencies and provides approximate posterior pdfs based on which the uncertainty in line spectral estimation can be quantified. Simulation results show that accounting for the uncertainty of frequency estimates, rather than computing just point estimates, significantly improves the performance. The performance of VALSE is superior to that of state-of-the-art methods and closely approaches the Cram{\textbackslash}'er-Rao bound computed for the true model order.},

The Bayesian framework is positioned at the core of modern AI technology for applications such as speech and image recognition and generation, medical analysis, robot navigation, and more. The framework describes how a rational agent should update its beliefs when new information is revealed by the agent's environment. Unfortunately, perfect Bayesian reasoning is generally intractable, since calculations of (often) very high-dimensional integrals are required for many models of interest. As a result, a number of numerical algorithms for approximating Bayesian inference have been developed and implemented in probabilistic programming packages.

The model that we consider is an extension of the DebtRank algorithm, recently introduced in the literature. The mechanics of distress propagation is very simple: When a bank suffers a loss, distress propagates to its creditors, who in turn suffer losses, and so on. The original DebtRank assumes that losses are propagated linearly between connected banks. Here we relax this assumption and introduce a one-parameter family of non-linear propagation functions. As a case study, we apply this algorithm to a data-set of 183 European banks, and we study how the stability of the system depends on the non-linearity parameter under different stress-test scenarios. We find that the system is characterized by a transition between a regime where small shocks can be amplified and a regime where shocks do not propagate, and that the overall stability of the system increases between 2008 and 2013.},

  abstract = {Fast Track is a formant tracker implemented in Praat that attempts to automatically select the best analysis from a set of candidates. The best track is selected by modeling smooth formant contours across the entirety of the sound, providing the researcher with rich information about static and dynamic formant properties. Fast Track returns text files containing acoustic information (formant frequencies, formant bandwidths, fundamental frequency, etc.) sampled every 2~ms, generates images showing the winning analysis and comparing alternate analyses, and creates log files detailing analysis information for each file. Fast Track features a modular workflow that allows for analysis steps to be run (and re-run) independently as necessary, and is designed to allow for easy correction of tracking errors by allowing the user to override the automatic analysis, or manually edit tracks where necessary. In addition, Fast Track includes tools to aggregate data across tokens, and to easily create vowel plots of mean values or time-varying formant contours. The design and use of Fast Track are outlined using a re-analysis of the Hillenbrand et~al. (1995) dataset, which suggests that Fast Track can be very accurate in cases where signal properties allow for reliable formant estimates.},

Examples of network architecture include modular, bipartite, and core-periphery structures. However inferring the network structure is a non trivial task and can depend sometimes on the chosen null model. Here we propose a method for classifying network structures and ranking its nodes in a statistically well-grounded fashion. The method is based on the use of Belief Propagation for learning through Entropy Maximization on both the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) and the degree-corrected Stochastic Block Model (dcSBM). As a specific application we show how the combined use of the two ensembles - SBM and dcSBM - allows to disentangle the bipartite and the core-periphery structure in the case of the e-MID interbank network. Specifically we find that, taking into account the degree, this interbank network is better described by a bipartite structure, while using the SBM the core-periphery structure emerges only when data are aggregated for more than a week.},

In this setting, kernel methods are employed more and more frequently, however, standard kernels do not perform well. Moreover, the role and mathematical implications of the underlying pair of kernels, which arises naturally in the complex-valued case, remain to be addressed. We introduce new reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of complex-valued functions, and formulate the problem of complex-valued interpolation with a kernel pair as minimum norm interpolation in these spaces. Moreover, we combine the interpolant with a low-order rational function, where the order is adaptively selected based on a new model selection criterion. Numerical results on examples from different fields, including electromagnetics and acoustic examples, illustrate the performance of the method, also in comparison to available rational approximation methods.},

The purpose of this work is to provide analytical tools to predict and evaluate the effectiveness of that redundancy. Integer binary Arithmetic Coding (AC) is modeled by a reduced-state automaton in order to obtain a bit-clock trellis describing the encoding process. Considering AC as a trellis code, distance spectra are then derived. In particular, an algorithm to compute the free distance of an arithmetic code is proposed. The obtained code properties allow to compute upper bounds on both bit error and symbol error probabilities and thus provide an objective criterion to analyze the behavior of JSCAC schemes when used on noisy channels. This criterion is then exploited to design efficient error-correcting arithmetic codes. Simulation results highlight the validity of the theoretical error bounds and show that for equivalent rate and complexity, a simple optimization yields JSCACs that outperform classical tandem schemes at low to medium SNR.},

Banks are subject to random liquidity shocks and can form links with potential trading partners to bilaterally Nash bargain about loan conditions. To reduce credit risk uncertainty, banks can engage in costly peer monitoring of counterparties. We estimate the structural model parameters by indirect inference using network statistics of the Dutch interbank market from 2008 to 2011. The estimated model accurately explains the high sparsity and stability of the lending network. In particular, peer monitoring and credit risk uncertainty are key factors in the formation of stable interbank lending relationships that are associated with improved credit conditions. Moreover, the estimated degree distribution of the lending network is highly skewed with a few very interconnected core banks and many peripheral banks that trade mainly with core banks. Shocks to credit risk uncertainty can lead to extended periods of low market activity, amplified by a reduction in peer monitoring. Finally, our monetary policy analysis shows that a wider interest rate corridor leads to a more active market through a direct effect on the outside options and an indirect multiplier effect by increasing banks' monitoring and search efforts.},

In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract = {A new method is proposed for solving the glottal inverse filtering (GIF) problem. The goal of GIF is to separate an acoustical speech signal into two parts: the glottal airflow excitation and the vocal tract filter. To recover such information one has to deal with a blind deconvolution problem. This ill-posed inverse problem is solved under a deterministic setting, considering unknowns on both sides of the underlying operator equation. A stable reconstruction is obtained using a double regularization strategy, alternating between fixing either the glottal source signal or the vocal tract filter. This enables not only splitting the nonlinear and nonconvex problem into two linear and convex problems, but also allows the use of the best parameters and constraints to recover each variable at a time. This new technique, called alternating minimization glottal inverse filtering (AM-GIF), is compared with two other approaches: Markov chain Monte Carlo glottal inverse filtering (MCMC-GIF), and iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF), using synthetic speech signals. The recent MCMC-GIF has good reconstruction quality but high computational cost. The state-of-the-art IAIF method is computationally fast but its accuracy deteriorates, particularly for speech signals of high fundamental frequency (F0). The results show the competitive performance of the new method: With high F0, the reconstruction quality is better than that of IAIF and close to MCMC-GIF while reducing the computational complexity by two orders of magnitude.},

  abstract = {The duration of vowel steady-states (VSS) was examined acoustically in the speech production of 40 normal young adults. VSS was assessed according to formant frequency changes in sustained /i/ productions and consonant +/i/ + /d/(/Cid/) productions. The duration of the VSS was measured for the first and second formants (Fl and F2) by incorporating a fixed rate-of-change criterion. Results indicated no significant differences in VSS duration according to gender or vowel context. VSS duration based on Fl was significantly longer than F2 VSS duration. The duration of VSS was also found to be correlated to the overall vowel duration in /Cid/ contexts. Discussion focuses on the analysis and application of VSS in acoustic studies of normal and disordered speech production.},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows expressing complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose a unified, efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function \$F\$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of \$F\$ and implicit differentiation to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many exiting implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.},

However, up until recently, attention was almost exclusively given to networks in which all components were treated on equivalent footing, while neglecting all the extra information about the temporal- or context-related properties of the interactions under study. Only in the last years, taking advantage of the enhanced resolution in real data sets, network scientists have directed their interest to the multiplex character of real-world systems, and explicitly considered the time-varying and multilayer nature of networks. We offer here a comprehensive review on both structural and dynamical organization of graphs made of diverse relationships (layers) between its constituents, and cover several relevant issues, from a full redefinition of the basic structural measures, to understanding how the multilayer nature of the network affects processes and dynamics.},

This attention is a timely response to the many urgent questions that this technology raises, but it can sometimes miss important considerations. This paper surveys the evidence for eight potentially surprising such points: 1. LLMs predictably get more capable with increasing investment, even without targeted innovation. 2. Many important LLM behaviors emerge unpredictably as a byproduct of increasing investment. 3. LLMs often appear to learn and use representations of the outside world. 4. There are no reliable techniques for steering the behavior of LLMs. 5. Experts are not yet able to interpret the inner workings of LLMs. 6. Human performance on a task isn't an upper bound on LLM performance. 7. LLMs need not express the values of their creators nor the values encoded in web text. 8. Brief interactions with LLMs are often misleading.},

We consider the von Neumann entropy of these matrices and we characterize the graphs for which the minimum and maximum values are attained. We then discuss the problem of separability by pointing out that separability of density matrices of graphs does not always depend on the labelling of the vertices. We consider graphs with a tensor product structure and simple cases for which combinatorial properties are linked to the entanglement of the state. We calculate the concurrence of all graph on four vertices representing entangled states. It turns out that for some of these graphs the value of the concurrence is exactly fractional.},

Exactly the same inferences will be made regardless of the underlying ensemble sampling distribution for the noise, provided the first and second moments of the true noise are the same. In this paper we review Jaynes' calculation, demonstrate it explicitly, generalize it to more complex models, and show that for regression style models the underlying ensemble sampling distribution for the noise is irrelevant to our inferences provided the mean and mean-square projection of the model onto the true noise are the same.},

A common statistical example is finite mixture modelling. In the Bayesian framework, these problems are typically solved using one of the following two methods: i) by executing a Monte Carlo algorithm (such as Nested Sampling) once for each possible value of \$N\$, and calculating the marginal likelihood or evidence as a function of \$N\$; or ii) by doing a single run that allows the model dimension \$N\$ to change (such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo with birth/death moves), and obtaining the posterior for \$N\$ directly. In this paper we present a general approach to this problem that uses trans-dimensional MCMC embedded within a Nested Sampling algorithm, allowing us to explore the posterior distribution and calculate the marginal likelihood (summed over \$N\$) even if the problem contains a phase transition or other difficult features such as multimodality. We present two example problems, finding sinusoidal signals in noisy data, and finding and measuring galaxies in a noisy astronomical image. Both of the examples demonstrate phase transitions in the relationship between the likelihood and the cumulative prior mass, highlighting the need for Nested Sampling.},

However, the time-varying dynamics of these associations are largely ignored due to a lack of methods that can assess the changing nature of the relationship through time. This article introduces a method for the simultaneous and automatic analysis of the association between the time-varying power spectrum and covariates. The procedure adaptively partitions the grid of time and covariate values into an unknown number of approximately stationary blocks and nonparametrically estimates local spectra within blocks through penalized splines. The approach is formulated in a fully Bayesian framework, in which the number and locations of partition points are random, and fit using reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques. Estimation and inference averaged over the distribution of partitions allows for the accurate analysis of spectra with both smooth and abrupt changes. The proposed methodology is used to analyze the association between the time-varying spectrum of heart rate variability and self-reported sleep quality in a study of older adults serving as the primary caregiver for their ill spouse.},

The latest model developed by OpenAI, GPT-4, was trained using an unprecedented scale of compute and data. In this paper, we report on our investigation of an early version of GPT-4, when it was still in active development by OpenAI. We contend that (this early version of) GPT-4 is part of a new cohort of LLMs (along with ChatGPT and Google's PaLM for example) that exhibit more general intelligence than previous AI models. We discuss the rising capabilities and implications of these models. We demonstrate that, beyond its mastery of language, GPT-4 can solve novel and difficult tasks that span mathematics, coding, vision, medicine, law, psychology and more, without needing any special prompting. Moreover, in all of these tasks, GPT-4's performance is strikingly close to human-level performance, and often vastly surpasses prior models such as ChatGPT. Given the breadth and depth of GPT-4's capabilities, we believe that it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system. In our exploration of GPT-4, we put special emphasis on discovering its limitations, and we discuss the challenges ahead for advancing towards deeper and more comprehensive versions of AGI, including the possible need for pursuing a new paradigm that moves beyond next-word prediction. We conclude with reflections on societal influences of the recent technological leap and future research directions.},

  abstract = {Nested sampling (NS) computes parameter posterior distributions and makes Bayesian model comparison computationally feasible. Its strengths are the unsupervised navigation of complex, potentially multi-modal posteriors until a well-defined termination point. A systematic literature review of nested sampling algorithms and variants is presented. We focus on complete algorithms, including solutions to likelihood-restricted prior sampling, parallelisation, termination and diagnostics. The relation between number of live points, dimensionality and computational cost is studied for two complete algorithms. A new formulation of NS is presented, which casts the parameter space exploration as a search on a tree. Previously published ways of obtaining robust error estimates and dynamic variations of the number of live points are presented as special cases of this formulation. A new on-line diagnostic test is presented based on previous insertion rank order work. The survey of nested sampling methods concludes with outlooks for future research.},

This stabilizes the MCMC proposal of later MCMC proposals, and leads to pleasant properties, including that the number of live points and number of MCMC steps do not have to be calibrated, that the evidence and posterior approximation improve as more compute is added and can be diagnosed with convergence diagnostics from the MCMC community. Snowballing nested sampling converges to a ``perfect'' nested sampling run with an infinite number of MCMC steps.},

The central idea is to learn a diffeomorphism, through normalizing flows, that maps the non-Gaussian structure of the target distribution to an approximately Gaussian distribution. We then use the elliptical slice sampler, an efficient and tuning-free Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, to sample from the transformed distribution. The samples are then pulled back using the inverse normalizing flow, yielding samples that approximate the stationary target distribution of interest. Our transport elliptical slice sampler (TESS) is optimized for modern computer architectures, where its adaptation mechanism utilizes parallel cores to rapidly run multiple Markov chains for a few iterations. Numerical demonstrations show that TESS produces Monte Carlo samples from the target distribution with lower autocorrelation compared to non-transformed samplers, and demonstrates significant improvements in efficiency when compared to gradient-based proposals designed for parallel computer architectures, given a flexible enough diffeomorphism.},

Despite evidence of its clinical utility, a clear explanation of how AT works is lacking, as the foundational science needed to test the underlying ideas has only recently become available. The authors propose that the core changes brought about by Alexander training are improvements in the adaptivity and distribution of postural tone, along with changes in body schema, and that these changes underlie many of the reported benefits. They suggest that AT alters tone and body schema via spatial attention and executive processes, which in turn affect low-level motor elements. To engage these pathways, AT strategically engages attention, intention, and inhibition, along with haptic communication. The uniqueness of the approach comes from the way these elements are woven together. Evidence for the contribution of these elements is discussed, drawing on direct studies of AT and other relevant modern scientific literature.},

To model complex and non-differentiable functions, these smoothness assumptions are often too restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different representation of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space is often learned in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data representations that are not useful for the overall regression task. In this paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel supervised method that jointly learns a transformation of the data into a feature space and a GP regression from the feature space to observed space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to learn data representations, which are useful for the overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as step functions and robotics tasks with contacts.},

  abstract = {Inverse problems deal with the quest for unknown causes of observed consequences, based on predictive models, known as the forward models, that associate the former quantities to the latter in the causal order. Forward models are usually well-posed, as causes determine consequences in a unique and stable way. Inverse problems, on the other hand, are usually ill-posed: the data may be insufficient to identify the cause unambiguously, an exact solution may not exist, and, like in a mystery story, discovering the cause without extra information tends to be highly sensitive to measurement noise and modeling errors. The Bayesian methodology provides a versatile and natural way of incorporating extra information to supplement the noisy data by modeling the unknown as a random variable to highlight the uncertainty about its value. Presenting the solution in the form of a posterior distribution provides a wide range of possibilities to compute useful estimates. Inverse problems are traditionally approached from the point of view of regularization, a process whereby the ill-posed problem is replaced by a nearby well-posed one. While many of the regularization techniques can be reinterpreted in the Bayesian framework through prior design, the Bayesian formalism provides new techniques to enrich the paradigm of traditional inverse problems. In particular, inaccuracies and inadequacies of the forward model are naturally handled in the statistical framework. Similarly, qualitative information about the solution may be reformulated in the form of priors with unknown parameters that can be successfully handled in the hierarchical Bayesian context.

  abstract = {Researchers have been studying approaches to steer the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and build personalized LLMs tailored for various applications. While fine-tuning seems to be a direct solution, it requires substantial computational resources and may significantly affect the utility of the original LLM. Recent endeavors have introduced more lightweight strategies, focusing on extracting "steering vectors" to guide the model's output toward desired behaviors by adjusting activations within specific layers of the LLM's transformer architecture. However, such steering vectors are directly extracted from the activations of human preference data and thus often lead to suboptimal results and occasional failures, especially in alignment-related scenarios. This work proposes an innovative approach that could produce more effective steering vectors through bi-directional preference optimization. Our method is designed to allow steering vectors to directly influence the generation probability of contrastive human preference data pairs, thereby offering a more precise representation of the target behavior. By carefully adjusting the direction and magnitude of the steering vector, we enabled personalized control over the desired behavior across a spectrum of intensities. Extensive experimentation across various open-ended generation tasks, particularly focusing on steering AI personas, has validated the efficacy of our approach. Moreover, we comprehensively investigate critical alignment-concerning scenarios, such as managing truthfulness, mitigating hallucination, and addressing jailbreaking attacks. Remarkably, our method can still demonstrate outstanding steering effectiveness across these scenarios. Furthermore, we showcase the transferability of our steering vectors across different models/LoRAs and highlight the synergistic benefits of applying multiple vectors simultaneously.},

  abstract = {This paper formulates the action of psychedelics by integrating the free-energy principle and entropic brain hypothesis. We call this formulation relaxed beliefs under psychedelics (REBUS) and the anarchic brain, founded on the principle that---via their entropic effect on spontaneous cortical activity---psychedelics work to relax the precision of high-level priors or beliefs, thereby liberating bottom-up information flow, particularly via intrinsic sources such as the limbic system. We assemble evidence for this model and show how it can explain a broad range of phenomena associated with the psychedelic experience. With regard to their potential therapeutic use, we propose that psychedelics work to relax the precision weighting of pathologically overweighted priors underpinning various expressions of mental illness. We propose that this process entails an increased sensitization of high-level priors to bottom-up signaling (stemming from intrinsic sources), and that this heightened sensitivity enables the potential revision and deweighting of overweighted priors. We end by discussing further implications of the model, such as that psychedelics can bring about the revision of other heavily weighted high-level priors, not directly related to mental health, such as those underlying partisan and/or overly-confident political, religious, and/or philosophical perspectives. Significance Statement Psychedelics are capturing interest, with efforts underway to bring psilocybin therapy to marketing authorisation and legal access within a decade, spearheaded by the findings of a series of phase 2 trials. In this climate, a compelling unified model of how psychedelics alter brain function to alter consciousness would have appeal. Towards this end, we have sought to integrate a leading model of global brain function, hierarchical predictive coding, with an often-cited model of the acute action of psychedelics, the entropic brain hypothesis. The resulting synthesis states that psychedelics work to relax high-level priors, sensitising them to liberated bottom-up information flow, which, with the right intention, care provision and context, can help guide and cultivate the revision of entrenched pathological priors.},

  abstract = {Determining the number G of components in a finite mixture distribution is an important and difficult inference issue. This is a most important question, because statistical inference about the resulting model is highly sensitive to the value of G. Selecting an erroneous value of G may produce a poor density estimate. This is also a most difficult question from a theoretical perspective as it relates to unidentifiability issues of the mixture model. This is further a most relevant question from a practical viewpoint since the meaning of the number of components G is strongly related to the modelling purpose of a mixture distribution. We distinguish in this chapter between selecting G as a density estimation problem in Section 2 and selecting G in a model-based clustering framework in Section 3. Both sections discuss frequentist as well as Bayesian approaches. We present here some of the Bayesian solutions to the different interpretations of picking the "right" number of components in a mixture, before concluding on the ill-posed nature of the question.},

Although our framework is general, we derive explicit approximation schemes for these constraints, and argue for the use of a log transformation for functions with high dynamic range such as likelihood surfaces. We propose a novel method for optimizing hyperparameters in this framework: we optimize the marginal likelihood in the original space, as opposed to in the transformed space. The result is a model that better explains the actual data. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate our framework achieves superior estimates using less wall-clock time than existing Bayesian quadrature procedures.},

This study addresses this gap and focuses on the acoustics of laryngeal voice quality, since voice quality has been reported to be one of the most popular and useful features for forensic voice comparison. 75 male speakers aged 18--45 were selected from a forensically-oriented database of Australian English speakers in Sydney/New South Wales. The evidential strength of a number of spectral tilt and additive noise parameters were tested under the Bayesian likelihood-ratio framework. Results show that system performance using these parameters as input were stable across 50 replications. When speech style is controlled for, VQ parameters yielded promising results and better system validity was achieved when using more VQ parameters. However, they offered limited speaker-discriminatory value when speech style mismatch is involved, and non-contemporaneous recordings only led to a small decline in performance. Overall, forensic practitioners should be cautious when using spectral tilt measures and additive noise measures as speaker discriminants in forensic casework.},

We further propose VI-DP-DAG, a new method for DAG learning from observational data which combines DP-DAG with variational inference. Hence, VI-DP-DAG approximates the posterior probability over DAG edges given the observed data. VI-DP-DAG is guaranteed to output a valid DAG at any time during training and does not require any complex augmented Lagrangian optimization scheme in contrast to existing differentiable DAG learning approaches. In our extensive experiments, we compare VI-DP-DAG to other differentiable DAG learning baselines on synthetic and real datasets. VI-DP-DAG significantly improves DAG structure and causal mechanism learning while training faster than competitors.},

  abstract = {Gaussian process model for vector-valued function has been shown to be useful for multi-output prediction. The existing method for this model is to re-formulate the matrix-variate Gaussian distribution as a multivariate normal distribution. Although it is effective in many cases, re-formulation is not always workable and is difficult to apply to other distributions because not all matrix-variate distributions can be transformed to respective multivariate distributions, such as the case for matrix-variate Student\$-t\$ distribution. In this paper, we propose a unified framework which is used not only to introduce a novel multivariate Student\$-t\$ process regression model (MV-TPR) for multi-output prediction, but also to reformulate the multivariate Gaussian process regression (MV-GPR) that overcomes some limitations of the existing methods. Both MV-GPR and MV-TPR have closed-form expressions for the marginal likelihoods and predictive distributions under this unified framework and thus can adopt the same optimization approaches as used in the conventional GPR. The usefulness of the proposed methods is illustrated through several simulated and real data examples. In particular, we verify empirically that MV-TPR has superiority for the datasets considered, including air quality prediction and bike rent prediction. At last, the proposed methods are shown to produce profitable investment strategies in the stock markets.},

  abstract = {Priors in Bayesian analyses often encode informative domain knowledge that can be useful in making the inference process more efficient. Occasionally, however, priors may be unrepresentative of the parameter values for a given dataset, which can result in inefficient parameter space exploration, or even incorrect inferences, particularly for nested sampling (NS) algorithms. Simply broadening the prior in such cases may be inappropriate or impossible in some applications. Hence our previous solution to this problem, known as posterior repartitioning (PR), redefines the prior and likelihood while keeping their product fixed, so that the posterior inferences and evidence estimates remain unchanged, but the efficiency of the NS process is significantly increased. In its most practical form, PR raises the prior to some power beta, which is introduced as an auxiliary variable that must be determined on a case-by-case basis, usually by lowering beta from unity according to some pre-defined `annealing schedule' until the resulting inferences converge to a consistent solution. Here we present a very simple yet powerful alternative Bayesian approach, in which beta is instead treated as a hyperparameter that is inferred from the data alongside the original parameters of the problem, and then marginalised over to obtain the final inference. We show through numerical examples that this Bayesian PR (BPR) method provides a very robust, self-adapting and computationally efficient `hands-off' solution to the problem of unrepresentative priors in Bayesian inference using NS. Moreover, unlike the original PR method, we show that even for representative priors BPR has a negligible computational overhead relative to standard nesting sampling, which suggests that it should be used as the default in all NS analyses.},

GPT-4, based on advanced LLMs, exhibits extraordinary multimodal capabilities beyond previous visual language models. We attribute this to the use of more advanced LLMs compared with previous multimodal models. Unfortunately, the model architecture and training strategies of GPT-4 are unknown. To endow LLMs with multimodal capabilities, we propose X-LLM, which converts Multi-modalities (images, speech, videos) into foreign languages using X2L interfaces and inputs them into a large Language model (ChatGLM). Specifically, X-LLM aligns multiple frozen single-modal encoders and a frozen LLM using X2L interfaces, where ``X'' denotes multi-modalities such as image, speech, and videos, and ``L'' denotes languages. X-LLM's training consists of three stages: (1) Converting Multimodal Information: The first stage trains each X2L interface to align with its respective single-modal encoder separately to convert multimodal information into languages. (2) Aligning X2L representations with the LLM: single-modal encoders are aligned with the LLM through X2L interfaces independently. (3) Integrating multiple modalities: all single-modal encoders are aligned with the LLM through X2L interfaces to integrate multimodal capabilities into the LLM. Our experiments show that X-LLM demonstrates impressive multimodel chat abilities, sometimes exhibiting the behaviors of multimodal GPT-4 on unseen images/instructions, and yields a 84.5{\textbackslash}\% relative score compared with GPT-4 on a synthetic multimodal instruction-following dataset. And we also conduct quantitative tests on using LLM for ASR and multimodal ASR, hoping to promote the era of LLM-based speech recognition.},

While sparse variational Gaussian process models are capable of learning from large-scale data, standard strategies for sparsifying the model can prevent the approximation of complex functions. In this work, we propose a novel variational Gaussian process model that decouples the representation of mean and covariance functions in reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that this new parametrization generalizes previous models. Furthermore, it yields a variational inference problem that can be solved by stochastic gradient ascent with time and space complexity that is only linear in the number of mean function parameters, regardless of the choice of kernels, likelihoods, and inducing points. This strategy makes the adoption of large-scale expressive Gaussian process models possible. We run several experiments on regression tasks and show that this decoupled approach greatly outperforms previous sparse variational Gaussian process inference procedures.},

  abstract = {Glottal inverse filtering aims to estimate the glottal airflow signal from a speech signal for applications such as speaker recognition and clinical voice assessment. Nonetheless, evaluation of inverse filtering algorithms has been challenging due to the practical difficulties of directly measuring glottal airflow. Apart from this, it is acknowledged that the performance of many methods degrade in voice conditions that are of great interest, such as breathiness, high pitch, soft voice, and running speech. This paper presents a comprehensive, objective, and comparative evaluation of state-of-the-art inverse filtering algorithms that takes advantage of speech and glottal airflow signals generated by a physiological speech synthesizer. The synthesizer provides a physics-based simulation of the voice production process and thus an adequate test bed for revealing the temporal and spectral performance characteristics of each algorithm. Included in the synthetic data are continuous speech utterances and sustained vowels, which are produced with multiple voice qualities (pressed, slightly pressed, modal, slightly breathy, and breathy), fundamental frequencies, and subglottal pressures to simulate the natural variations in real speech. In evaluating the accuracy of a glottal flow estimate, multiple error measures are used, including an error in the estimated signal that measures overall waveform deviation, as well as an error in each of several clinically relevant features extracted from the glottal flow estimate. Waveform errors calculated from glottal flow estimation experiments exhibited mean values around 30\% for sustained vowels, and around 40\% for continuous speech, of the amplitude of true glottal flow derivative. Closed-phase approaches showed remarkable stability across different voice qualities and subglottal pressures. The algorithms of choice, as suggested by significance tests, are closed-phase covariance analysis for the analysis of sustained vowels, and sparse linear prediction for the analysis of continuous speech. Results of data subset analysis suggest that analysis of close rounded vowels is an additional challenge in glottal flow estimation.},

At the same time, thanks to the deep connection between the principle of maximum entropy and information theory, statistical physics has led to the definition of null models for networks that reproduce features of real-world systems but that are otherwise as random as possible. We review here the statistical physics approach and the null models for complex networks, focusing in particular on analytical frameworks that reproduce local network features. We show how these models have been used to detect statistically significant structural patterns in real-world networks and to reconstruct the network structure in cases of incomplete information. We further survey the statistical physics models that reproduce more complex, semilocal network features using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, as well as models of generalized network structures, such as multiplex networks, interacting networks and simplicial complexes.},

  abstract = {The performance of speech recognition systems is often improved by accounting explicitly for sources of variability in the data. In the SWITCHBOARD corpus, studied during the 1994 CAIP workshop [Frontiers in Speech Processing Workshop II, CAIP (August 1994)], an attempt was made to compensate for the systematic variability due to different vocal tract lengths of various speakers. The method found a maximum probability parameter for each speaker which mapped an acoustic model to the mean of the models taken from a homogeneous speaker population. The underlying acoustic model was that of a straight tube, and the parameter estimation was accomplished by warping the spectrum of each speaker linearly over a 20\% range (actually accomplished by digitally resampling the data), and finding the maximum a\hphantom{,}posteriori probability of the data given the warp. The technique produces statistically significant improvements in accuracy on a speech transcription task using each of four different speech recognition systems. The best parametrizations were later found to correlate well with vocal tract estimates computed manually from spectrograms.},

  abstract = {Language is universal, but it has few indisputably universal characteristics, with cross-linguistic variation being the norm. For example, languages differ greatly in the number of syllables they allow, resulting in large variation in the Shannon information per syllable. Nevertheless, all natural languages allow their speakers to efficiently encode and transmit information. We show here, using quantitative methods on a large cross-linguistic corpus of 17 languages, that the coupling between language-level (information per syllable) and speaker-level (speech rate) properties results in languages encoding similar information rates ({\textasciitilde}39 bits/s) despite wide differences in each property individually: Languages are more similar in information rates than in Shannon information or speech rate. These findings highlight the intimate feedback loops between languages' structural properties and their speakers' neurocognition and biology under communicative pressures. Thus, language is the product of a multiscale communicative niche construction process at the intersection of biology, environment, and culture. Human languages encode similar average information rates ({\textasciitilde}39 bits/s) despite their remarkable differences.

Since AR parameters are usually found via maximum-likelihood, least squares or the method of moments, AR-based SE fails to account for the uncertainty of the approximate PSD, and thus only yields point estimates. We propose to handle the uncertainty related to the AR approximation by finding the full posterior distribution of the AR parameters to then propagate this uncertainty to the PSD approximation by integrating out the AR parameters; we implement this concept by assuming two different priors over the model noise. Through practical experiments, we show that the proposed Bayesian autoregressive spectral estimation (BASE) provides point estimates that follow closely those of standard autoregressive spectral estimation (ASE), while also providing error bars. BASE is validated against ASE and the Periodogram on both synthetic and real-world signals.},

We present an extensive study of its dynamics on complex networks, that can be considered as the most natural topological embedding for agents involved in language games and opinion dynamics. Except for some community structured networks on which metastable phases can be observed, agents playing the Naming Game always manage to reach a global consensus. This convergence is obtained after a time generically scaling with the population's size \$N\$ as \$t\_\{conv\} {\textbackslash}sim N{\textasciicircum}\{1.4 {\textbackslash}pm 0.1\}\$, i.e. much faster than for agents embedded on regular lattices. Moreover, the memory capacity required by the system scales only linearly with its size. Particular attention is given to heterogenous networks, in which the dynamical activity pattern of a node depends on its degree. High degree nodes have a fundamental role, but require larger memory capacity. They govern the dynamics acting as spreaders of (linguistic) conventions. The effects of other properties, such as the average degree and the clustering, are also discussed.},

However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximized over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximizing an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from iid observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the nonlinear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain inputs and semi-supervised Gaussian processes. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high resolution video data.},

Empirical studies have shown that homophily results in polarization. However, we show that DeGroot's well-known model of opinion formation based on repeated averaging can never be polarizing, even if individuals are arbitrarily homophilous. We generalize DeGroot's model to account for a phenomenon well-known in social psychology as biased assimilation: when presented with mixed or inconclusive evidence on a complex issue, individuals draw undue support for their initial position thereby arriving at a more extreme opinion. We show that in a simple model of homophilous networks, our biased opinion formation process results in either polarization, persistent disagreement or consensus depending on how biased individuals are. In other words, homophily alone, without biased assimilation, is not sufficient to polarize society. Quite interestingly, biased assimilation also provides insight into the following related question: do internet based recommender algorithms that show us personalized content contribute to polarization? We make a connection between biased assimilation and the polarizing effects of some random-walk based recommender algorithms that are similar in spirit to some commonly used recommender algorithms.},

These can be described as a multilayer network where each layer represents one type of interaction. These layers may be interdependent in complicated ways, revealing different kinds of structure in the network. In this work we present a generative model, and an efficient expectation-maximization algorithm, which allows us to perform inference tasks such as community detection and link prediction in this setting. Our model assumes overlapping communities that are common between the layers, while allowing these communities to affect each layer in a different way, including arbitrary mixtures of assortative, disassortative, or directed structure. It also gives us a mathematically principled way to define the interdependence between layers, by measuring how much information about one layer helps us predict links in another layer. In particular, this allows us to bundle layers together to compress redundant information, and identify small groups of layers which suffice to predict the remaining layers accurately. We illustrate these findings by analyzing synthetic data and two real multilayer networks, one representing social support relationships among villagers in South India and the other representing shared genetic substrings material between genes of the malaria parasite.},

While such practices are useful for the rapid collection of acoustic data from large corpora, they, by default do not permit human analysts to provide quality control or make hand corrected measurements when needed. Under ideal signal-to-noise conditions, such as in a sound-proof room, this may not be a problem. However, analysis of audio recordings made in acoustically-uncontrolled environments, like many standard sociolinguistic interviews, are arguably susceptible to spurious estimates using automated routines. This paper presents the results of a highly controlled noise-interference experiment designed to examine the effects of different types of noise at varying signal-to-noise levels on automated LPC-based vowel formant measurements made in Praat. Findings indicate that some noises are more detrimental than others, affect some formant frequencies more than others and that louder noises make it inappropriate to conduct an analysis of F1 and F2. Results are discussed and suggestions for better practices in recording sociolinguistic interviews for sociophonetic data collection are presented.},

  abstract = {A network representation is useful for describing the structure of a large variety of complex systems. However, most real and engineered systems have multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and the data produced by such systems are very rich. Achieving a deep understanding of such systems necessitates generalizing ``traditional'' network theory, and the newfound deluge of data now makes it possible to test increasingly general frameworks for the study of networks. In particular, although adjacency matrices are useful to describe traditional single-layer networks, such a representation is insufficient for the analysis and description of multiplex and time-dependent networks. One must therefore develop a more general mathematical framework to cope with the challenges posed by multilayer complex systems. In this paper, we introduce a tensorial framework to study multilayer networks, and we discuss the generalization of several important network descriptors and dynamical processes---including degree centrality, clustering coefficients, eigenvector centrality, modularity, von Neumann entropy, and diffusion---for this framework. We examine the impact of different choices in constructing these generalizations, and we illustrate how to obtain known results for the special cases of single-layer and multiplex networks. Our tensorial approach will be helpful for tackling pressing problems in multilayer complex systems, such as inferring who is influencing whom (and by which media) in multichannel social networks and developing routing techniques for multimodal transportation systems.},

  abstract = {Many complex systems can be represented as networks composed by distinct layers, interacting and depending on each others. For example, in biology, a good description of the full protein-protein interactome requires, for some organisms, up to seven distinct network layers, with thousands of protein-protein interactions each. A fundamental open question is then how much information is really necessary to accurately represent the structure of a multilayer complex system, and if and when some of the layers can indeed be aggregated. Here we introduce a method, based on information theory, to reduce the number of layers in multilayer networks, while minimizing information loss. We validate our approach on a set of synthetic benchmarks, and prove its applicability to an extended data set of protein-genetic interactions, showing cases where a strong reduction is possible and cases where it is not. Using this method we can describe complex systems with an optimal trade--off between accuracy and complexity.},

  abstract = {Unveiling the community structure of networks is a powerful methodology to comprehend interconnected systems across the social and natural sciences. To identify different types of functional modules in interaction data aggregated in a single network layer, researchers have developed many powerful methods. For example, flow-based methods have proven useful for identifying modular dynamics in weighted and directed networks that capture constraints on flow in the systems they represent. However, many networked systems consist of agents or components that exhibit multiple layers of interactions. Inevitably, representing this intricate network of networks as a single aggregated network leads to information loss and may obscure the actual organization. Here we propose a method based on compression of network flows that can identify modular flows in non-aggregated multilayer networks. Our numerical experiments on synthetic networks show that the method can accurately identify modules that cannot be identified in aggregated networks or by analyzing the layers separately. We capitalize on our findings and reveal the community structure of two multilayer collaboration networks: scientists affiliated to the Pierre Auger Observatory and scientists publishing works on networks on the arXiv. Compared to conventional aggregated methods, the multilayer method reveals smaller modules with more overlap that better capture the actual organization.},

Presently COVAREP contains contributions from five distinct laboratories and we encourage contributions from across the speech processing research field.

The system we investigate is a paradigmatic case study for complex networks since it undergoes dramatic structural changes over time and links among nodes can be observed at several time scales. We find a scale-free decay of the fraction of drivers with increasing time resolution, implying that policies have to be adjusted to the time scales in order to be effective. Moreover, drivers are often not the most highly connected "hub" institutions, nor the largest lenders, contrary to the results of other studies. Our findings contribute quantitative indicators which can support regulators in developing more effective supervision and intervention policies.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new technique for high-accuracy tracking of vocal-tract resonances (which coincide with formants for nonnasalized vowels) in natural speech. The technique is based on a discretized nonlinear prediction function, which is embedded in a temporal constraint on the quantized input values over adjacent time frames as the prior knowledge for their temporal behavior. The nonlinear prediction is constructed, based on its analytical form derived in detail in this paper, as a parameter-free, discrete mapping function that approximates the ``forward'' relationship from the resonance frequencies and bandwidths to the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) cepstra of real speech. Discretization of the function permits the ``inversion'' of the function via a search operation. We further introduce the nonlinear-prediction residual, characterized by a multivariate Gaussian vector with trainable mean vectors and covariance matrices, to account for the errors due to the functional approximation. We develop and describe an expectation--maximization (EM)-based algorithm for training the parameters of the residual, and a dynamic programming-based algorithm for resonance tracking. Details of the algorithm implementation for computation speedup are provided. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of our new paradigm for tracking vocal-tract resonances. In particular, we show the effectiveness of training the prediction-residual parameters in obtaining high-accuracy resonance estimates, especially during consonantal closure.},

The algorithm uses a hidden dynamic model, with a state-space formulation, where the resonance frequency and bandwidth values are treated as continuous-valued hidden state variables. The observation equation of the model is constructed by an analytical predictive function from the resonance frequencies and bandwidths to LPC cepstra as the observation vectors. This nonlinear function is adaptively linearized, and a residual or bias term, which is adaptively trained, is added to the nonlinear function to represent the iteratively reduced piecewise linear approximation error. Details of the piecewise linearization design process are described. An iterative tracking algorithm is presented, which embeds both the adaptive residual training and piecewise linearization design in the Kalman filtering/smoothing framework. Experiments on estimating resonances in Switchboard speech data show accurate estimation results. In particular, the effectiveness of the adaptive residual training is demonstrated. Our approach provides a solution to the traditional "hidden formant problem," and produces meaningful results even during consonantal closures when the supra-laryngeal source may cause no spectral prominences in speech acoustics},

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters{\textasciitilde}(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3\% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.},

Then the source/filter speech model can be interpreted as an excitation/filter speech model, the " filter " comprising the glottal flow, vocal tract and radiation components. The spectral features of the voice source models are reviewed, both in the amplitude and phase domains. In the spectral amplitude domain the main features are a spectral maximum (the " glottal formant ") and spectral tilt. Evidence for a mixed causal/anticausal phase behavior of the source is given. Then, a causal-anticausal linear filter voice source model is designed. In conclusion, applications of this new approach are discussed for voice quality modification, voice source estimation, voice quality perception.},

A unified set of time-domain equations is derived, and their analytical Laplace-transform computation leads to a set of frequency-domain equations. On the basis of this mathematical framework, the spectral properties of the glottal-flow models and their derivatives are studied. It is shown that any glottal-flow model can be described by a combination of low-pass filters, the cut-off frequencies and amplitudes of which can be expressed directly in terms of time-domain parameters. The spectral correlates of time-domain glottal-flow parameters are then explored. It is shown that the maximum excitation corresponds to a gain factor, and that it controls the mid-to-high-frequency spectral slope. A non-null return-phase quotient adds an additional spectral tilt in the high-frequency part of the glottal-flow spectrum. The open quotient and asymmetry coefficient are related to the low-frequency spectral peak, also called the glottal formant. The glottal-formant frequency is mainly controlled by the open quotient, and its amplitude (or bandwidth) by the asymmetry coefficient. As a direct application, it is shown that the amplitude difference between the first two harmonics, commonly assumed to be correlated to the open quotient, is also theoretically dependent on the asymmetry coefficient.},

Via a systematic study of the windowing effects on the deconvolution quality, we show that the complex cepstrum causal--anticausal decomposition can be effectively used for glottal flow estimation when specific windowing criteria are met. It is also shown that this complex cepstral decomposition gives similar glottal estimates as obtained with the ZZT method. However, as complex cepstrum uses FFT operations instead of requiring the factoring of high-degree polynomials, the method benefits from a much higher speed. Finally in our tests on a large corpus of real expressive speech, we show that the proposed method has the potential to be used for voice quality analysis.},

  abstract = {The pseudo-periodicity of voiced speech can be exploited in several speech processing applications. This requires however that the precise locations of the glottal closure instants (GCIs) are available. The focus of this paper is the evaluation of automatic methods for the detection of GCIs directly from the speech waveform. Five state-of-the-art GCI detection algorithms are compared using six different databases with contemporaneous electroglottographic recordings as ground truth, and containing many hours of speech by multiple speakers. The five techniques compared are the Hilbert Envelope-based detection (HE), the Zero Frequency Resonator-based method (ZFR), the Dynamic Programming Phase Slope Algorithm (DYPSA), the Speech Event Detection using the Residual Excitation And a Mean-based Signal (SEDREAMS) and the Yet Another GCI Algorithm (YAGA). The efficacy of these methods is first evaluated on clean speech, both in terms of reliabililty and accuracy. Their robustness to additive noise and to reverberation is also assessed. A further contribution of the paper is the evaluation of their performance on a concrete application of speech processing: the causal-anticausal decomposition of speech. It is shown that for clean speech, SEDREAMS and YAGA are the best performing techniques, both in terms of identification rate and accuracy. ZFR and SEDREAMS also show a superior robustness to additive noise and reverberation.},

  abstract = {Source-tract decomposition (or glottal flow estimation) is one of the basic problems of speech processing. For this, several techniques have been proposed in the literature. However studies comparing different approaches are almost nonexistent. Besides, experiments have been systematically performed either on synthetic speech or on sustained vowels. In this study we compare three of the main representative state-of-the-art methods of glottal flow estimation: closed-phase inverse filtering, iterative and adaptive inverse filtering, and mixed-phase decomposition. These techniques are first submitted to an objective assessment test on synthetic speech signals. Their sensitivity to various factors affecting the estimation quality, as well as their robustness to noise are studied. In a second experiment, their ability to label voice quality (tensed, modal, soft) is studied on a large corpus of real connected speech. It is shown that changes of voice quality are reflected by significant modifications in glottal feature distributions. Techniques based on the mixed-phase decomposition and on a closed-phase inverse filtering process turn out to give the best results on both clean synthetic and real speech signals. On the other hand, iterative and adaptive inverse filtering is recommended in noisy environments for its high robustness.},

This review gives a general overview of techniques which have been designed for glottal source processing. Starting from fundamental analysis tools of pitch tracking, glottal closure instant detection, glottal flow estimation and modelling, this paper then highlights how these solutions can be properly integrated within various voice technology applications.},

The behaviour of the undriven and sinusoidally driven discretized model is examined numerically. The undriven model describes the behaviour of a discrete number of coupled oscillators, which, if uncoupled, would have limit cycles gradually differing in frequency. In the coupled case the limit cycle behaviour is less predictable: it appears to exhibit quasi stochastic properties. In the driven model a sufficiently strong stimulus causes entrainment to the stimulus, and odd order harmonics appear. In the range where the driven response is small compared with the average limit cycle, the response is almost linear. The strict Van der Pol-damping function, which is parabolic in velocity, produces strong saturation. A generalized Van der Pol-damping term, which causes small-amplitude instability and large-amplitude stability, produces much the same general behaviour, but the intensity response can be modelled more realistically.},

We argue that, on the computational side, it is important to move from toy problems to the full complexity of the learning situation, and take as input as faithful reconstructions of the sensory signals available to infants as possible. On the data side, accessible but privacy-preserving repositories of home data have to be setup. On the psycholinguistic side, specific tests have to be constructed to benchmark humans and machines at different linguistic levels.

Our approach is based on Gaussian process regression, which provides a flexible non-parametric framework for modelling periodic data. We introduce a novel decomposition of the covariance function as the sum of periodic and aperiodic kernels. This decomposition allows for the creation of sub-models which capture the periodic nature of the signal and its complement. To quantify the periodicity of the signal, we derive a periodicity ratio which reflects the uncertainty in the fitted sub-models. Although the method can be applied to many kernels, we give a special emphasis to the Mat{\'e}rn family, from the expression of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space inner product to the implementation of the associated periodic kernels in a Gaussian process toolkit. The proposed method is illustrated by considering the detection of periodically expressed genes in the arabidopsis genome.},

This unification enables the initialisation and training of the DGP as a neural network, leveraging the well established practice in the deep learning community, and so greatly aiding the inference task.

  abstract = {Language models (LMs) are powerful tools for natural language processing, but they often struggle to produce coherent and fluent text when they are small. Models with around 125M parameters such as GPT-Neo (small) or GPT-2 (small) can rarely generate coherent and consistent English text beyond a few words even after extensive training. This raises the question of whether the emergence of the ability to produce coherent English text only occurs at larger scales (with hundreds of millions of parameters or more) and complex architectures (with many layers of global attention). In this work, we introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset of short stories that only contain words that a typical 3 to 4-year-olds usually understand, generated by GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. We show that TinyStories can be used to train and evaluate LMs that are much smaller than the state-of-the-art models (below 10 million total parameters), or have much simpler architectures (with only one transformer block), yet still produce fluent and consistent stories with several paragraphs that are diverse and have almost perfect grammar, and demonstrate reasoning capabilities. We also introduce a new paradigm for the evaluation of language models: We suggest a framework which uses GPT-4 to grade the content generated by these models as if those were stories written by students and graded by a (human) teacher. This new paradigm overcomes the flaws of standard benchmarks which often requires the model's output to be very structures, and moreover provides a multidimensional score for the model, providing scores for different capabilities such as grammar, creativity and consistency. We hope that TinyStories can facilitate the development, analysis and research of LMs, especially for low-resource or specialized domains, and shed light on the emergence of language capabilities in LMs.},

Speech comprehension has been shown to be robust to spectral and temporal degradations, but the specific relevance of particular degradations is arguable due to the complexity of the joint spectral and temporal information in the speech signal. We applied a novel modulation filtering technique to recorded sentences to restrict acoustic information quantitatively and to obtain a joint spectrotemporal modulation transfer function for speech comprehension, the speech MTF. For American English, the speech MTF showed the criticality of low modulation frequencies in both time and frequency. Comprehension was significantly impaired when temporal modulations 12 Hz or spectral modulations 4 cycles/kHz were removed. More specifically, the MTF was bandpass in temporal modulations and low-pass in spectral modulations: temporal modulations from 1 to 7 Hz and spectral modulations 1 cycles/kHz were the most important. We evaluated the importance of spectrotemporal modulations for vocal gender identification and found a different region of interest: removing spectral modulations between 3 and 7 cycles/kHz significantly increases gender misidentifications of female speakers. The determination of the speech MTF furnishes an additional method for producing speech signals with reduced bandwidth but high intelligibility. Such compression could be used for audio applications such as file compression or noise removal and for clinical applications such as signal processing for cochlear implants.},

  abstract = {The use of complex and powerful risk management methods has been one of the key innovations in the banking sector over the past two decades. One of the factors driving this development is certainly that since the early 1970s banks have had to cope with a significantly more volatile and dynamic environment compared to the years following World War II. In the immediate post-war period, currency crises were largely insignificant, market interest rates fluctu- ated only negligibly, competition was limited by cartels and interest rate regu- lation, and competition by financial intermediaries outside the banking sector was insignificant. Once the Bretton Woods system had collapsed, the situation changed drastically, however. Exchange rate risks started to play a role, interest rate fluctuations reached previously unknown dimensions, the lifting of capital controls resulted in a considerable internationalization of the financial system, and competition by nonbanks increased strongly. New technologies and means of communications rendered barriers to competition, such as distance and national borders, obsolete. In addition, financial innovations abounded. Against this background, regulators started to exert more pressure on banks. As capital adequacy provisions were continuously extended and refined, regulators relied heavily on individual risk management models. In the public these regulatory measures were invariably justified by pointing out the need to attenuate systemic risks and strengthen financial stability. The question remains, however, whether improving risk management models and implementing capital adequacy guide- lines at the level of individual banks automatically leads to more efficient risk control at the level of the banking system.},

All the discussed evidences are then used in two small Monte Carlo studies, wherein for different sample sizes and noise levels the evidences are used to select between competing C-spline regression models. Also, there is given, for illustrative purposes, an outline on how to construct simple trivariate C-spline regression models.

We show that objectives for aligning LLMs with human feedback implicitly incorporate many of these biases -- the success of these objectives (e.g., DPO) over cross-entropy minimization can partly be ascribed to them being \${\textbackslash}textit\{human-aware loss functions\}\$ (HALOs). However, the utility functions these methods attribute to humans still differ from those in the prospect theory literature. Using a Kahneman-Tversky model of human utility, we propose a HALO that directly maximizes the utility of generations instead of maximizing the log-likelihood of preferences, as current methods do. We call this approach Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO), and it matches or exceeds the performance of preference-based methods at scales from 1B to 30B. Crucially, KTO does not need preferences -- only a binary signal of whether an output is desirable or undesirable for a given input. This makes it far easier to use in the real world, where preference data is scarce and expensive.},

The accuracy and economy of the MULTINEST algorithm are demonstrated by application to two toy problems and to a cosmological inference problem focusing on the extension of the vanilla {$\Lambda$} cold dark matter model to include spatial curvature and a varying equation of state for dark energy.

Here we consider the problem of optimal coding -- under an arbitrary coding scheme -- and show that it predicts Zipf's law of abbreviation, namely a tendency in natural languages for more frequent words to be shorter. We apply this result to investigate optimal coding also under so-called nonsingular coding, a scheme where unique segmentation is not warranted but codes stand for a distinct number. Optimal non-singular coding predicts that the length of a word should grow approximately as the logarithm of its frequency rank, which is again consistent with Zipf's law of abbreviation. Optimal non-singular coding in combination with the maximum entropy principle also predicts Zipf's rank-frequency distribution. Furthermore, our findings on optimal non-singular coding challenge common beliefs about random typing. It turns out that random typing is in fact an optimal coding process, in stark contrast with the common assumption that it is detached from cost cutting considerations. Finally, we discuss the implications of optimal coding for the construction of a compact theory of Zipfian laws more generally as well as other linguistic laws.},

Hand and pen positions, pen pressure, and a graphical user interface are assigned to specific vocal controls. This interface allows for real-time accurate control over high-level singing synthesis parameters. The sound generation system is based on a parametric synthesizer that features a spectral voice source model, a vocal tract model consisting of parallel filters for vocalic formants and cascaded with anti-resonance for the spectral effect of hypo-pharynx cavities, and rules for parameter settings and source/filter dependencies between fundamental frequency, vocal effort, and formants. Because Cantor Digitalis is a parametric system, every aspect of voice quality can be controlled (e.g., vocal tract size, aperiodicities in the voice source, vowels, and so forth). It offers several presets for different voice types. Cantor Digitalis has been played on stage in several public concerts, and it has also been proven to be useful as a tool for voice pedagogy. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive technical overview of Cantor Digitalis.},

A Brownian path is continuous but nowhere differentiable, and this nonsmoothness is associated with technical complications that can be daunting. However, there is another approach to random processes that is more elementary, involving smooth random functions defined by finite Fourier series with random coefficients or, equivalently, by trigonometric polynomial interpolation through random data values. We show here how smooth random functions can provide a very practical way to explore random effects. For example, one can solve smooth random ordinary differential equations using standard mathematical definitions and numerical algorithms, rather than having to develop new definitions and algorithms of stochastic differential equations. In the limit as the number of Fourier coefficients defining a smooth random function goes to \${\textbackslash}infty\$, one obtains the usual stochastic objects in what is known as their Stratonovich interpretation.},

  abstract = {The current study examines the performance of cluster analysis with dichotomous data using distance measures based on response pattern similarity. In many contexts, such as educational and psychological testing, cluster analysis is a useful means for exploring datasets and identifying un- derlying groups among individuals. However, standard approaches to cluster analysis assume that the variables used to group observations are continu- ous in nature. This paper focuses on four methods for calculating distance between individuals using dichotomous data, and the subsequent introduc- tion of these distances to a clustering algorithm such as Ward's. The four methods in question, are potentially useful for practitioners because they are relatively easy to carry out using standard statistical software such as SAS and SPSS, and have been shown to have potential for correctly grouping ob- servations based on dichotomous data. Results of both a simulation study and application to a set of binary survey responses show that three of the four measures behave similarly, and can yield correct cluster recovery rates of between 60\% and 90\%. Furthermore, these methods were found to work better, in nearly all cases, than using the raw data with Ward's clustering algorithm.},

We show that the networks appear to be random at the daily level, but contain significant non-random structure for longer aggregation periods. In this sense, the daily networks cannot be considered as being representative for the underlying `latent' network. Rather, the development of various network statistics under time aggregation points toward strong non-random determinants of link formation. We also identify the global financial crisis as a significant structural break for many network measures.}

Exponential random graph models are a principled theoretical framework to generate such constrained ensembles, but which often fail in practice, either due to model inconsistency or due to the impossibility to sample networks from them. These problems affect the important case of networks with prescribed clustering coefficient or number of small connected subgraphs (motifs). In this Letter we use the Wang-Landau method to obtain a multicanonical sampling that overcomes both these problems. We sample, in polynomial time, networks with arbitrary degree sequences from ensembles with imposed motifs counts. Applying this method to social networks, we investigate the relation between transitivity and homophily, and we quantify the correlation between different types of motifs, finding that single motifs can explain up to 60\% of the variation of motif profiles.},

  abstract = {The growing field of large-scale time domain astronomy requires methods for probabilistic data analysis that are computationally tractable, even with large datasets. Gaussian Processes are a popular class of models used for this purpose but, since the computational cost scales, in general, as the cube of the number of data points, their application has been limited to small datasets. In this paper, we present a novel method for Gaussian Process modeling in one-dimension where the computational requirements scale linearly with the size of the dataset. We demonstrate the method by applying it to simulated and real astronomical time series datasets. These demonstrations are examples of probabilistic inference of stellar rotation periods, asteroseismic oscillation spectra, and transiting planet parameters. The method exploits structure in the problem when the covariance function is expressed as a mixture of complex exponentials, without requiring evenly spaced observations or uniform noise. This form of covariance arises naturally when the process is a mixture of stochastically-driven damped harmonic oscillators -- providing a physical motivation for and interpretation of this choice -- but we also demonstrate that it can be a useful effective model in some other cases. We present a mathematical description of the method and compare it to existing scalable Gaussian Process methods. The method is fast and interpretable, with a range of potential applications within astronomical data analysis and beyond. We provide well-tested and documented open-source implementations of this method in C++, Python, and Julia.},

  abstract = {This article reports three experiments designed to explore the basis for speech perceivers' apparent compensations for coarticulation. In the first experiment, the stimuli were members of three /da/-to-/ga/ continua hybridized from natural speech. The monosyllables had originally been produced in disyllables /ada/ and /aga/ to make Continuum 1, /alda/ and /alga/ (Continuum 2), and /arda/ and /arga/ (Continuum 3). Members of the second and third continua were influenced by carryover coarticulation from the preceding /l/ or /r/ context. Listeners showed compensation for this carryover coarticulation in the absence of the precursor /al/ or /ar/ syllables. This rules out an account in which compensation for coarticulation reflects a spectral contrast effect exerted by a precursor syllable, as previously has been proposed by Lotto, Holt, and colleagues (e.g., Lotto, Kluender, \& Holt, 1997; Lotto \& Kluender, 1998). The second experiment showed an enhancing effect of the endpoint monosyllables in Experiment 1 on identifications of preceding natural hybrids along an /al/-to-/ar/ continuum. That is, coarticulatory /l/ and /r/ information in /da/ and /ga/ syllables led to increased judgments of /l/ and /r/, respectively, in the precursor /al/-to-/ar/ continuum members. This was opposite to the effect, in Experiment 3, of /da/ and /ga/ syllables on preceding tones synthesized to range in frequency from approximately the ending F3 of /ar/ to the ending F3 of /al/. The enhancing, not contrastive, effect in Experiment 2, juxtaposed to the contrastive effect in Experiment 3, further disconfirms the spectral contrast account of compensation for coarticulation. A review of the literature buttresses that conclusion and provides strong support for an account that invokes listeners' attention to information in speech for the occurrence of gestural overlap.},

Whilst presenting many potential advantages, their probabilistic counterparts are not widely used, essentially because of the computational load and the lack of clear interpretability of the different underlying models. However, using state space models, they have been shown recently to be equivalent to Spectral Mixtures Gaussian processes (SM-GP). This pioneer work unlocks this problem and opens the path for the development of tractable and interpretable probabilistic time--frequency analysis. In this paper, we propose a relatively simple yet a significant improvement of that work in terms of computational complexity, flexibility and practical application. To do so, we use a recent approach for covariance approximation to develop an algorithm for faster inference of SM-GP, while opting for a frequency-domain approach to hyperparameter learning. We illustrate the practical potential of our method using voiced speech data. We first show that key speech features can be accurately learned from the data. Second, we show that our method can yield better performances in denoising.},

  abstract = {The universal law of generalization describes how animals discriminate between alternative sensory stimuli. On an appropriate perceptual scale, the probability that an organism perceives two stimuli as similar typically declines exponentially with the difference on the perceptual scale. Exceptions often follow a Gaussian probability pattern rather than an exponential pattern. Previous explanations have been based on underlying theoretical frameworks such as information theory, Kolmogorov complexity, or empirical multidimensional scaling. This article shows that the few inevitable invariances that must apply to any reasonable perceptual scale provide a sufficient explanation for the universal exponential law of generalization. In particular, reasonable measurement scales of perception must be invariant to shift by a constant value, which by itself leads to the exponential form. Similarly, reasonable measurement scales of perception must be invariant to multiplication, or stretch, by a constant value, which leads to the conservation of the slope of discrimination with perceptual difference. In some cases, an additional assumption about exchangeability or rotation of underlying perceptual dimensions leads to a Gaussian pattern of discrimination, which can be understood as a special case of the more general exponential form. The three measurement invariances of shift, stretch, and rotation provide a sufficient explanation for the universally observed patterns of perceptual generalization. All of the additional assumptions and language associated with information, complexity, and empirical scaling are superfluous with regard to the broad patterns of perception. scaling patterns {\textbar} categorization {\textbar} sensory information {\textbar} animal behavior {\textbar} probability theory T he probability that an organism perceives two stimuli as similar typically decays exponentially with separation between the stimuli. The exponential decay in perceptual similarity is often referred to as the universal law of generalization (1, 2). "Generalization" arises because perceived similarity may describe recognition of a general category. For example, two circles may have different sizes, colors, and shadings. Perceived similarity arises from the generalized perception of "circle" as a category. "Universal law" arises because many empirical observations fit the pattern for diverse sensory modalities across different species. Typical exceptions take on a Gaussian probability pattern for perceived separation (3). Both theory and empirical analysis depend on the definition of the perceptual scale. How does one translate the perceived differences between two circles with different properties into a quantitative measurement scale? There are many different suggestions in the literature for how to define a perceptual scale. Each of those suggestions develop very specific notions of measurement based, for example, on information theory, Kolmogorov complexity theory, or multidimen-sional scaling descriptions derived from observations (1, 2, 4). I focus on the minimal properties that any reasonable perceptual measurement scale must have rather than on detailed assumptions motivated by external theories of information, complexity , or empirical scaling. I express the minimal properties as simple invariances. I show that a few inevitable invariances of any reasonable perceptual scale determine the exponential form for the universal law of generalization in perception. All of the other details of information, complexity, and empirical scaling are superfluous with respect to understanding why the universal law of generalization has the exponential form. I also show that, when the separation between stimuli depends on various underlying perceptional dimensions, it sometimes makes sense to assume that the perceptual scale will also obey exchangeability or rotational invariance. When that additional invariance holds, the universal law takes on the Gaussian form, which I show to be a special case of the general exponential form. Basic Problem and Notation Chater and Vit{\'a}nyi (ref. 2, p. 346) state the law as "the probability of perceiving similarity or analogy between two items, a and b, is a negative exponential function of the distance d (a, b) between them in an internal psychological space." Let the notation P (R b {\textbar}Sa) describe the probability of a positive response, R b , to the event b, given an initial stimulus, Sa , by the event a. A positive response expresses the perceived similarity of b to a, which may also be thought of as expressing the generalization that b and a belong to the same category. The goal here is to understand how the perceived similarity of b to a, observed as R b {\textbar}Sa , translates into a continuous psychological measurement scale, T b{\textbar}a , so that P (R b {\textbar}Sa) {$\equiv$} f (T b{\textbar}a) [1] for a suitably defined mapping R b {\textbar}Sa {$\rightarrow$} T b{\textbar}a and probability distribution function, f. We seek the characteristics of the mapping and the associated function, f. Significance When an animal is presented with two stimuli, it may consider them similar or different. Similarity often expresses a generalized notion of a category, such as two circles with different sizes, shadings, and colors both being circles. In many studies, perception of similarity declines exponentially with the measure of separation, a pattern often called the universal law of generalization. This article shows that the universal exponential law can be explained by simple properties any reasonable perceptual scale must have. A shift of the scale by a constant amount, or a stretch by a constant amount, should not change the animal's ability to perceive generalities or differences. Those invariant measurement properties by themselves explain why perceived generalization follows an exponential pattern.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is an approach to optimizing objective functions that take a long time (minutes or hours) to evaluate. It is best-suited for optimization over continuous domains of less than 20 dimensions, and tolerates stochastic noise in function evaluations. It builds a surrogate for the objective and quantifies the uncertainty in that surrogate using a Bayesian machine learning technique, Gaussian process regression, and then uses an acquisition function defined from this surrogate to decide where to sample. In this tutorial, we describe how Bayesian optimization works, including Gaussian process regression and three common acquisition functions: expected improvement, entropy search, and knowledge gradient. We then discuss more advanced techniques, including running multiple function evaluations in parallel, multi-fidelity and multi-information source optimization, expensive-to-evaluate constraints, random environmental conditions, multi-task Bayesian optimization, and the inclusion of derivative information. We conclude with a discussion of Bayesian optimization software and future research directions in the field. Within our tutorial material we provide a generalization of expected improvement to noisy evaluations, beyond the noise-free setting where it is more commonly applied. This generalization is justified by a formal decision-theoretic argument, standing in contrast to previous ad hoc modifications.},

Glottal inverse filtering (GIF) techniques can become instrumental to identify specific characteristics of both the glottal source signal and the vocal tract transfer function to resemble expressive speech. Several GIF methods have been proposed in the literature; however, their comparison becomes difficult due to the lack of common and exhaustive experimental settings. In this work, first, a two-phase analysis methodology for the comparison of GIF techniques based on a reference dataset is introduced. Next, state-of-the-art GIF techniques based on iterative adaptive inverse filtering (IAIF) and quasi closed phase (QCP) approaches are thoroughly evaluated on OPENGLOT, an open database specifically designed to evaluate GIF, computing well-established GIF error measures after extending male vowels with their female counterparts. The results show that GIF methods obtain better results on male vowels. The QCP-based techniques significantly outperform IAIF-based methods for almost all error metrics and scenarios and are, at the same time, more stable across sex, phonation type, F0, and vowels. The IAIF variants improve the original technique for most error metrics on male vowels, while QCP with spectral tilt compensation achieves a lower spectral tilt error for male vowels than the original QCP.},

  abstract = {This paper describes a robust glottal source estimation method based on a joint source-filter separation technique. In this method, the Liljencrants--Fant (LF) model, which models the glottal flow derivative, is integrated into a time-varying ARX speech production model. These two models are estimated in a joint optimization procedure, in which a Kalman filtering process is embedded for adaptively identifying the vocal tract parameters. Since the formulated joint estimation problem is a multiparameter nonlinear optimization procedure, we separate the optimization procedure into two passes. The first pass initializes the glottal source and vocal tract models by solving a quasi-convex approximate optimization problem. Having robust initial values, the joint estimation procedure determines the accuracy of model estimation implemented with a trust-region descent optimization algorithm. Experiments with synthetic and real voice signals show that the proposed method is a robust glottal source parameter estimation method with a high degree of accuracy.},

The de facto standard is to rely on Gaussian variational families, which come with numerous advantages: they are easy to sample from, simple to parametrize, and many expectations are known in closed-form or readily computed by quadrature. In this paper, we view the Gaussian variational approximation problem through the lens of gradient flows. We introduce a flexible and efficient algorithm based on a linear flow leading to a particle-based approximation. We prove that, with a sufficient number of particles, our algorithm converges linearly to the exact solution for Gaussian targets, and a low-rank approximation otherwise. In addition to the theoretical analysis, we show, on a set of synthetic and real-world high-dimensional problems, that our algorithm outperforms existing methods with Gaussian targets while performing on a par with non-Gaussian targets.},

We present an efficient and general approach to GP inference based on Blackbox Matrix-Matrix multiplication (BBMM). BBMM inference uses a modified batched version of the conjugate gradients algorithm to derive all terms for training and inference in a single call. BBMM reduces the asymptotic complexity of exact GP inference from \$O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$ to \$O(n{\textasciicircum}2)\$. Adapting this algorithm to scalable approximations and complex GP models simply requires a routine for efficient matrix-matrix multiplication with the kernel and its derivative. In addition, BBMM uses a specialized preconditioner to substantially speed up convergence. In experiments we show that BBMM effectively uses GPU hardware to dramatically accelerate both exact GP inference and scalable approximations. Additionally, we provide GPyTorch, a software platform for scalable GP inference via BBMM, built on PyTorch.},

We find that real networks are always either correlated or anticorrelated, and that networks of the same type (economic, social, cellular, financial, ecological, etc.) display similar values of the reciprocity. The observed patterns are not reproduced by current models. This leads us to introduce a more general framework where mutual links occur with a conditional connection probability. In some of the studied networks we discuss the form of the conditional connection probability and the size dependence of the reciprocity.},

Our analysis reveals that (i) the ecosystem is heterogeneous at several levels: content types are heterogeneous, users specialize in a few content types, and countries are heterogeneous in user profiles; and (ii) there is a strong correlation between socioeconomic indicators of a country and users behavior. Our findings open a research area on the dynamics of decentralized sharing ecosystems and the socioeconomic factors affecting them, and may have implications for the design of algorithms and for policymaking.},

Pixel gray levels and the presence and orientation of edges are viewed as states of atoms or molecules in a lattice-like physical system. The assignment of an energy function in the physical system determines its Gibbs distribution. Because of the Gibbs distribution, Markov random field (MRF) equivalence, this assignment also determines an MRF image model. The energy function is a more convenient and natural mechanism for embodying picture attributes than are the local characteristics of the MRF. For a range of degradation mechanisms, including blurring, nonlinear deformations, and multiplicative or additive noise, the posterior distribution is an MRF with a structure akin to the image model. By the analogy, the posterior distribution defines another (imaginary) physical system. Gradual temperature reduction in the physical system isolates low energy states (``annealing''), or what is the same thing, the most probable states under the Gibbs distribution. The analogous operation under the posterior distribution yields the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of the image given the degraded observations. The result is a highly parallel ``relaxation'' algorithm for MAP estimation. We establish convergence properties of the algorithm and we experiment with some simple pictures, for which good restorations are obtained at low signal-to-noise ratios.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference offers us a powerful tool with which to tackle the problem of data modelling. However the performance of Bayesian methods is crucially dependent on being able to find good models for our data. The principal focus of this thesis is the development of models based on Gaussian process priors. Such models, which can be thought of as the infinite extension of several existing finite models have the flexibility to model complex phenomena while being mathematically simple. In thesis, I present a review of the theory of Gaussian processes and their covariance functions and demonstrate how they fit into the Bayesian framework. The efficient implementation of a Gaussian process is discussed with particular reference to approximate methods for matrix inversion based on the work of Skilling (1993). Several regression problems are examined. Non-stationary covariance functions are developed for the regression of neuron spike data and the use of Gaussian processes to model the potential energy surfaces of weakly bound molecules is discussed. Classification methods based on Gaussian processes are implemented using variational methods. Existing bounds (Jaakkola and Jordan 1996) for the sigmoid function are used to tackle binary problems and multi-dimensional bounds on the softmax function are presented for the multiple class case. The performance of the variational classifier is compared with that of other methods using the CRABS and PIMA datasets (Ripley 1996) and the problem of predicting the cracking of welds based on their chemical composition is also investigated. The theoretical calculation of the density of states of crystal structures is discussed in detail. Three possible approaches to the problem are described based on free energy minimization, Gaussian processes and the theory of random matrices. Results from these approaches are compared with the state-of-the-art techniques (Pickard 1997).},

Furthermore, we use the log ratio of entropy powers to analyze the change in mutual information as the model order is increased for autoregressive processes. We examine when we can substitute the minimum mean squared prediction error for the entropy power in the log ratio of entropy powers, thus greatly simplifying the calculations to obtain the differential entropy and the change in mutual information and therefore increasing the utility of the approach. Applications to speech processing and coding are given and potential applications to seismic signal processing, EEG classification, and ECG classification are described.},

We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.},

  abstract = {Precise specification of the voice source would facilitate better modelling of expressive nuances in human spoken interaction. This paper focuses on the transformed version of the widely used LF voice source model, and proposes an algorithm which makes it possible to use the waveshape parameter Rd to directly control the LF pulse, for more effective analysis and synthesis of voice modulations. The Rd parameter, capturing much of the natural covariation between glottal parameters, is central to the transformed LF model. It is used to predict the standard R-parameters, which in turn are used to synthesise the LF waveform. However, the LF pulse that results from these predictions may have an Rd value noticeably different from the specified Rd, yielding undesirable artefacts, particularly when the model is used for detailed analysis and synthesis of non-modal voice. A further limitation is that only a subset of possible Rd values can be used, to avoid conflicting LF parameter settings. To eliminate these problems, a new iterative algorithm was developed based on the NewtonRaphson method for two variables, but modified to include constraints. This ensures that the correct Rd is always obtained and that the algorithm converges for effectively all permissible Rd values.},

  abstract = {No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.},

These are problems for which the model function is a linear combination of nonlinear functions. Taking advantage of this special structure, the method of variable projections eliminates the linear variables obtaining a somewhat more complicated function that involves only the nonlinear parameters. This procedure not only reduces the dimension of the parameter space but also results in a better-conditioned problem. The same optimization method applied to the original and reduced problems will always converge faster for the latter. We present first a historical account of the basic theoretical work and its various computer implementations, and then report on a variety of applications from electrical engineering, medical and biological imaging, chemistry, robotics, vision, and environmental sciences. An extensive bibliography is included. The method is particularly well suited for solving real and complex exponential model fitting problems, which are pervasive in their applications and are notoriously hard to solve.},

Here, we present a broad characterization of its performance in such situations. First, we revisit and clarify the resolution limit phenomenon for modularity maximization. Second, we show that the modularity function Q exhibits extreme degeneracies: it typically admits an exponential number of distinct high-scoring solutions and typically lacks a clear global maximum. Third, we derive the limiting behavior of the maximum modularity Q\_max for one model of infinitely modular networks, showing that it depends strongly both on the size of the network and on the number of modules it contains. Finally, using three real-world metabolic networks as examples, we show that the degenerate solutions can fundamentally disagree on many, but not all, partition properties such as the composition of the largest modules and the distribution of module sizes. These results imply that the output of any modularity maximization procedure should be interpreted cautiously in scientific contexts. They also explain why many heuristics are often successful at finding high-scoring partitions in practice and why different heuristics can disagree on the modular structure of the same network. We conclude by discussing avenues for mitigating some of these behaviors, such as combining information from many degenerate solutions or using generative models.},

However, most existing approaches do not scale to the size of networks that we regularly observe in the real world. In this paper, we develop a scalable approach to community detection that discovers overlapping communities in massive real-world networks. Our approach is based on a Bayesian model of networks that allows nodes to participate in multiple communities, and a corresponding algorithm that naturally interleaves subsampling from the network and updating an estimate of its communities. We demonstrate how we can discover the hidden community structure of several real-world networks, including 3.7 million US patents, 575,000 physics articles from the arXiv preprint server, and 875,000 connected Web pages from the Internet. Furthermore, we demonstrate on large simulated networks that our algorithm accurately discovers the true community structure.

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new method for the accurate estimation and tracking of formants in speech signals using time-varying quasi-closed-phase (TVQCP) analysis. Conventional formant tracking methods typically adopt a two-stage estimateand-track strategy wherein an initial set of formant candidates are estimated using short-time analysis (e.g., 10-50 ms), followed by a tracking stage based on dynamic programming or a linear state-space model. One of the main disadvantages of these approaches is that the tracking stage, however good it may be, cannot improve upon the formant estimation accuracy of the first stage. The proposed TVQCP method provides a single-stage formant tracking that combines the estimation and tracking stages into one. TVQCP analysis combines three approaches to improve formant estimation and tracking: (1) it uses temporally weighted quasi-closed-phase analysis to derive closed-phase estimates of the vocal tract with reduced interference from the excitation source, (2) it increases the residual sparsity by using the L1 optimization and (3) it uses time-varying linear prediction analysis overlong time windows (e.g., 100-200 ms) to impose a continuity constraint on the vocal tract model and hence on the formant trajectories. Formant tracking experiments with a wide variety of synthetic and natural speech signals show that the proposed TVQCP method performs better than conventional and popular formant tracking tools, such as Wavesurfer and Praat (based on dynamic programming), the KARMA algorithm (based on Kalman filtering), and DeepFormants (based on deep neural networks trained in a supervised manner).

  abstract = {A recent paper (Greenwood, 1990) has reviewed some of the data in the literature on the frequency-position coordinates of the cochlear partition in a number of species and the degree to which they are fitted by empirical functions developed in 1961 (Greenwood, 1961b, 1974b). Continued confirmation by physiological data makes this frequency-position function more independent of non-physiological data and provides a more secure means of testing possible relations of psychoacoustic data to cochlear coordinates. The present paper reviews various sets of critical band, or similar, data in humans and other species and finds that a considerable body of bandwidth estimates correspond to equal distances along the cochlear partition (on this assumption), confirming also to an exponential function of distance. As shown in 1961, such a function would imply that the same set of bandwidths is also a linear function of frequency. Some of the early critical bandwidth, and also 'consonant interval', estimates in man correspond to equal distances on the cochlear partition to a degree not generally recognized. Thus above about 300 to 500 Hz most of the critical band data (of Zwicker and G{\"a}ssler collated by Zwicker et al., 1957), correspond quite well to equal distances on the B{\'e}k{\'e}sy-Skarstein cochlear map fitted by the frequency-position function, as opposed to the values published in the critical band table or curve (which do not do so above 3 kHz). Consonant interval data tend to correspond closely to equal distances, from below 100 Hz to about 3 kHz. Certain post-1961 'critical band' (ERB) estimates collated by Moore and Glasberg (1983) and extended by Moore et al. (1990) and Shailer et al. (1990) also correspond quite closely to constant distances calculated by the 1961 function. So too do some, but not all, of the frequency intervals shown by Plomp (1964) and Plomp and Mimpen (1968) to be required to resolve the components of a harmonic complex. Some critical bandwidth data from animal studies may also correspond approximately to equal distances. This survey of old and new results, plotted on a rational distance scale, may assist in explaining what potential mix of factors operates to determine the estimated bandwidths when the values differ across experiments or in different frequency ranges. The correspondence, in the preponderance of cases, of critical bandwidth to a constant distance may facilitate an understanding of the operational definitions of critical bandwidth in different experiments and of the common underlying mechanisms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {In 1956, Stevens 'commissioned' an experiment to equisect a pitch difference between two tones. Results appear to reveal a methodological flaw that would invalidate the Mel Scale (Stevens and Volkmann, 1940). Stevens sought to distinguish sensory continua, e.g., loudness and pitch, on various criteria. He expected that the pitch continuum would not exhibit 'hysteresis'; i.e., that subjects dividing a pitch difference ({$\Delta$}f) into equal-appearing parts would not set dividing frequencies higher when listening to notes in ascending order than in descending order. Seven subjects equisected a pitch difference, between tones of 400 and 7000 Hz, into equal-seeming parts by adjusting the frequencies of three intermediate tones. All seven exhibited hysteresis, contrary to expectation. This outcome bears on other issues. Years prior, Stevens suggested that equal pitch differences might correspond to equal cochlear distances, but not to equal frequency ratios nor to equal musical intervals (Stevens and Davis, 1938; Stevens and Volkmann, 1940). In 1960 (reported now), both the 1940 Mel Scale and the equal pitch differences of 1956 were compared to equal cochlear distances, using a frequency-position function that fitted Bekesy's cochlear map (Greenwood, 1961, 1990). When ascending and descending settings were combined to contra-pose biases, equal pitch differences did coincide with equal distances - which the Mel Scale did not. Further, the biased ascending-order data coincided with the Mel Scale, suggesting the Mel Scale was similarly biased. Thus, the combined-order equal pitch differences of 1956 - but not the Mel Scale - are consistent with equal cochlear distances. However, since the map between 400 and 7000 Hz is nearly logarithmic, equal frequency ratios also approximate equal distances. Ironically, above 400 Hz, Bekesy's map and Stevens' equal-distance hypothesis jointly imply that musical intervals will nearly agree with equal pitch differences, which Stevens thought he had disconfirmed. However, given Bekesy's map, only near the cochlear apex will equal distances not approximate equal frequency ratios; and Pratt's (Pratt, 1928) bisections of {$\Delta$}fs greater than an octave indicated that equal pitch differences, on average, did agree with equal distances. However, they did so for only two of four subjects and coincided instead with qual frequency ratios for one musical subject. Historical distinctions suggest that between the parts of equisected {$\Delta$}fs subjective equivalence may be of two kinds - one linked to musical intervals, leading to equal frequency ratios; a second linked to 'tone-height' and 'distance', leading to deviations from equal frequency ratios near the apex, though not appreciably if equisected {$\Delta$}fs are less than an octave (or if perhaps subjects are musicians). Data of other kinds suggest that, if pure-tone pitch height were a function of place, the place could be the apical excitation-pattern edge, in any case not a maximum, which in neural data shifts and disappears with tone level.},

From this new perspective the spectral resolution achievable is directly dependent on the signal to noise ratio and can be orders of magnitude better than that of a conventional Fourier power spectrum or periodogram.

However, classic SBMs are not limited to assortative structures. In this study, we discuss the implications of this model-inherent indifference towards assortativity or disassortativity, and show that this characteristic can lead to undesirable outcomes for networks which are presupposedy assortative but which contain a reduced amount of information. To circumvent this issue, we introduce a constrained SBM that imposes strong assortativity constraints, along with efficient algorithmic approaches to solve it. These constraints significantly boost community recovery capabilities in regimes that are close to the information-theoretic threshold. They also permit to identify structurally-different communities in networks representing cerebral-cortex activity regions.},

Hearing two phonetically related stops in a VC-CV pair (V = vowel; C = consonant) requires 150 ms more closure time than hearing two phonetically different stops in a VC1-C2V pair. Closure time also varies with long-term stimulus rate. The model simulates rate-dependent category boundaries that emerge from feedback interactions between a working memory for short-term storage of phonetic items and a list categorization network for grouping sequences of items. The conscious speech code is a resonant wave. It emerges after bottom-up signals from the working memory select list chunks which read out top-down expectations that amplify and focus attention on consistent working memory items. In VC1-C2V pairs, resonance is reset by mismatch of C2 with the C1 expectation. In VC-CV pairs, resonance prolongs a repeated C.},

H. Repp, A. M. Liberman, T. Eccardt, \& D. Pesetsky, 1978). The ARTWORD neural model quantitatively simulates such context-sensitive speech data. In ARTWORD, sequentially stored phonemic items in working memory provide bottom-up input to unitized list chunks that group together sequences of items of variable length.

The winning groupings feed back to establish a resonance which temporarily boosts the activation levels of selected items and chunks, thereby creating an emergent conscious percept whose properties match such data.},

  abstract = {Multiple sound sources often contain harmonics that overlap and may be degraded by environmental noise. The auditory system is capable of teasing apart these sources into distinct mental objects, or streams. Such an 'auditory scene analysis' enables the brain to solve the cocktail party problem. A neural network model of auditory scene analysis, called the ARTSTREAM model, is presented to propose how the brain accomplishes this feat. The model clarifies how the frequency components that correspond to a given acoustic source may be coherently grouped together into a distinct stream based on pitch and spatial location cues. The model also clarifies how multiple streams may be distinguished and separated by the brain. Streams are formed as spectral-pitch resonances that emerge through feedback interactions between frequency-specific spectral representations of a sound source and its pitch. First, the model transforms a sound into a spatial pattern of frequency-specific activation across a spectral stream layer. The sound has multiple parallel representations at this layer. A sound's spectral representation activates a bottom-up filter that is sensitive to the harmonics of the sound's pitch. This filter activates a pitch category which, in turn, activates a top-down expectation that is also sensitive to the harmonics of the pitch. Resonance develops when the spectral and pitch representations mutually reinforce one another. Resonance provides the coherence that allows one voice or instrument to be tracked through a noisy multiple source environment. Spectral components are suppressed if they do not match harmonics of the top-down expectation that is read-out by the selected pitch, thereby allowing another stream to capture these components, as in the 'old-plus-new heuristic' of Bregman. Multiple simultaneously occurring spectral-pitch resonances can hereby emerge. These resonance and matching mechanisms are specialized versions of Adaptive Resonance Theory, or ART, which clarifies how pitch representations can self-organize during learning of harmonic bottom-up filters and top-down expectations. The model also clarifies how spatial location cues can help to disambiguate two sources with similar spectral cues. Data are simulated from psychophysical grouping experiments, such as how a tone sweeping upwards in frequency creates a bounce percept by grouping with a downward sweeping tone due to proximity in frequency, even if noise replaces the tones at their intersection point. Illusory auditory percepts are also simulated, such as the auditory continuity illusion of a tone continuing through a noise burst even if the tone is not present during the noise, and the scale illusion of Deutsch whereby downward and upward scales presented alternately to the two ears are regrouped based on frequency proximity, leading to a bounce percept. Since related sorts of resonances have been used to quantitatively simulate psychophysical data about speech perception, the model strengthens the hypothesis that ART-like mechanisms are used at multiple levels of the auditory system. Proposals for developing the model to explain more complex streaming data are also provided.},

In these scenarios it may be beneficial to trade the cost of collecting an environmental measurement against the quality or "fidelity" of this measurement and how the measurement affects changepoint estimation. For instance, one might decide between inertial measurements or GPS to determine changepoints for motion. A Bayesian approach to changepoint detection is particularly appealing because we can represent our posterior uncertainty about changepoints and make active, cost-sensitive decisions about data fidelity to reduce this posterior uncertainty. Moreover, the total cost could be dramatically lowered through active fidelity switching, while remaining robust to changes in data distribution. We propose a multi-fidelity approach that makes cost-sensitive decisions about which data fidelity to collect based on maximizing information gain with respect to changepoints. We evaluate this framework on synthetic, video, and audio data and show that this information-based approach results in accurate predictions while reducing total cost.},

With RNN-LM rescoring and lattice combination on the 5 systems trained across three different phone sets, our 2017 speech recognition system has obtained 5.0\% and 9.1\% on Switchboard and CallHome, respectively, both of which are the best word error rates reported thus far. According to IBM in their latest work to compare human and machine transcriptions, our reported Switchboard word error rate can be considered to surpass the human parity (5.1\%) of transcribing conversational telephone speech.},

Rather than using a reconstruction-based loss, we use a discriminative, multimodal grounding objective which forces the learned units to be useful for semantic image retrieval. We evaluate the sub-word units on the ZeroSpeech 2019 challenge, achieving a 27.3\% reduction in ABX error rate over the top-performing submission, while keeping the bitrate approximately the same. We also present experiments demonstrating the noise robustness of these units. Finally, we show that a model with multiple quantizers can simultaneously learn phone-like detectors at a lower layer and word-like detectors at a higher layer. We show that these detectors are highly accurate, discovering 279 words with an F1 score of greater than 0.5.},

  abstract = {Continuous-time neural networks are a class of machine learning systems that can tackle representation learning on spatiotemporal decision-making tasks. These models are typically represented by continuous differential equations. However, their expressive power when they are deployed on computers is bottlenecked by numerical differential equation solvers. This limitation has notably slowed down the scaling and understanding of numerous natural physical phenomena such as the dynamics of nervous systems. Ideally, we would circumvent this bottleneck by solving the given dynamical system in closed form. This is known to be intractable in general. Here, we show that it is possible to closely approximate the interaction between neurons and synapses---the building blocks of natural and artificial neural networks---constructed by liquid time-constant networks efficiently in closed form. To this end, we compute a tightly bounded approximation of the solution of an integral appearing in liquid time-constant dynamics that has had no known closed-form solution so far. This closed-form solution impacts the design of continuous-time and continuous-depth neural models. For instance, since time appears explicitly in closed form, the formulation relaxes the need for complex numerical solvers. Consequently, we obtain models that are between one and five orders of magnitude faster in training and inference compared with differential equation-based counterparts. More importantly, in contrast to ordinary differential equation-based continuous networks, closed-form networks can scale remarkably well compared with other deep learning instances. Lastly, as these models are derived from liquid networks, they show good performance in time-series modelling compared with advanced recurrent neural network models.},

However, existing LLM-based large multimodal models (e.g., Video-LLaMA, VideoChat) can only take in a limited number of frames for short video understanding. In this study, we mainly focus on designing an efficient and effective model for long-term video understanding. Instead of trying to process more frames simultaneously like most existing work, we propose to process videos in an online manner and store past video information in a memory bank. This allows our model to reference historical video content for long-term analysis without exceeding LLMs' context length constraints or GPU memory limits. Our memory bank can be seamlessly integrated into current multimodal LLMs in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments on various video understanding tasks, such as long-video understanding, video question answering, and video captioning, and our model can achieve state-of-the-art performances across multiple datasets.

We illustrate three scenarios in which ActivityNet can be used to compare algorithms for human activity understanding: untrimmed video classification, trimmed activity classification and activity detection.},

This algorithm has several advantages over traditional distance-based agglomerative clustering algorithms. (1) It defines a probabilistic model of the data which can be used to compute the predictive distribution of a test point and the probability of it belonging to any of the existing clusters in the tree. (2) It uses a model-based criterion to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are advantageous and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm can be interpreted as a novel fast bottom-up approximate inference method for a Dirichlet process (i.e. countably infinite) mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning the model hyperparameters, computing the predictive distribution, and extensions to the algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate useful properties of the algorithm.},

These use multidimensional, continuous state-spaces to overcome familiar issues with discrete-state, HMM-based speech models. The added dimensions allow the state to represent and describe more than just temporal structure as systematic differences in mean, rather than as mere correlations in a residual (which dynamic features or AR-HMMs do). Being based on Gaussian processes, the models avoid restrictive parametric or linearity assumptions on signal structure. We outline GPDM theory, and describe model setup and initialization schemes relevant to speech applications. Experiments demonstrate subjectively better quality of synthesized speech than from comparable HMMs. In addition, there is evidence for unsupervised discovery of salient speech structure.},

  abstract = {The general projected normal distribution is a simple and intuitive model for directional data in any dimension: a multivariate normal random vector divided by its length is the projection of that vector onto the surface of the unit hypersphere. Observed data consist of the projections, but not the lengths. Inference for this model has been restricted to the two-dimensional (circular) case, using Bayesian methods with data augmentation to generate the latent lengths and a Metropolis-within-Gibbs algorithm to sample from the posterior. We describe a new parameterization of the general projected normal distribution that makes inference in any dimension tractable, including the important three-dimensional (spherical) case, which has not previously been considered. Under this new parameterization, the full conditionals of the unknown parameters have closed forms, and we propose a new slice sampler to draw the latent lengths without the need for rejection. Gibbs sampling with this new scheme is fast and easy, leading to improved Bayesian inference; for example, it is now feasible to conduct model selection among complex mixture and regression models for large data sets. Our parameterization also allows straightforward incorporation of covariates into the covariance matrix of the multivariate normal, increasing the ability of the model to explain directional data as a function of independent regressors. Circular and spherical cases are considered in detail and illustrated with scientific applications. For the circular case, seasonal variation in time-of-day departures of anglers from recreational fishing sites is modeled using covariates in both the mean vector and covariance matrix. For the spherical case, we consider paired angles that describe the relative positions of carbon atoms along the backbone chain of a protein. We fit mixtures of general projected normals to these data, with the best-fitting mixture accurately describing biologically meaningful structures including helices, {$\beta$}-sheets, and coils and turns. Finally, we show via simulation that our methodology has satisfactory performance in some 10-dimensional and 50-dimensional problems.},

There is always some variation in the waveform over time for signals which are labeled as periodic but which are not truly deterministic.

A measure called a signal coherence function of the amount of random variation in each Fourier component of the signal is defined and its statistical properties are developed. This signal coherence function is very different from the coherence function between two stationary signals.

Using complementary priors, we derive a fast, greedy algorithm that can learn deep, directed belief networks one layer at a time, provided the top two layers form an undirected associative memory. The fast, greedy algorithm is used to initialize a slower learning procedure that fine-tunes the weights using a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm. After fine-tuning, a network with three hidden layers forms a very good generative model of the joint distribution of handwritten digit images and their labels. This generative model gives better digit classification than the best discriminative learning algorithms. The low-dimensional manifolds on which the digits lie are modelled by long ravines in the free-energy landscape of the top-level associative memory and it is easy to explore these ravines by using the directed connections to display what the associative memory has in mind.},

Deep neural networks with many hidden layers, that are trained using new methods have been shown to outperform Gaussian mixture models on a variety of speech recognition benchmarks, sometimes by a large margin.

The Forward-Forward algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, one with positive (i.e. real) data and the other with negative data which could be generated by the network itself. Each layer has its own objective function which is simply to have high goodness for positive data and low goodness for negative data. The sum of the squared activities in a layer can be used as the goodness but there are many other possibilities, including minus the sum of the squared activities. If the positive and negative passes could be separated in time, the negative passes could be done offline, which would make the learning much simpler in the positive pass and allow video to be pipelined through the network without ever storing activities or stopping to propagate derivatives.},

A well-chosen set of Gaussian basis functions forms an approximate complete set in a finite coordinate space so that it can describe accurately short-range corielations and long-range asymptotic behavior as well as highly oscillatory character of wave functions in the bound and the scattering states of the systems. Examples of applications of GEM include i) the latest determination of antiproton mass by the analysis of laser spectroscopic data for antiprotonic helium atoms, ii) predictions and experimental verifications on the structure of hypernuclei and hyperon-nucleon interactions, iii) Coulomb three-body calculations of bound and resonant states of muonic molecules as well as muon transfer reactions in muon catalyzed fusion cycles, iv) a new treatment of CDCC (continuum-discretized coupled channels) method for three- and four-body breakup processes, and v) benchmark test calculations for three- and four-nucleon bound states using realistic interactions.},

Results suggested that pressure may have different influences in low and high pitch in this speech task. It is suggested that unexpected results of increased pressure in low pitch were related to maintaining voice quality, that is, avoiding vocal fry. In high pitch, the increased pressure may serve to maintain vocal fold vibration. The findings suggested different underlying laryngeal mechanisms and vocal adjustments for increasing and decreasing F0 from normal pitch.},

  abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology -- from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids -- can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via email, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks.},

The resulting partial differential equations have no standard solution. Only for some special cases satisfactory methods are known. I present a new algorithmic approach which is not based on differential equations. In contrast to other methods this technique also works if the embedding exists only locally. The fundamental idea is to estimate Euclidean distances, from which the surface is built up. In this paper I focus on the reconstruction of a surface from these estimated distances. Particular the influence of a perturbation of the distances on the shape of the resulting surface is investigated.},

Artists create contexts by deploying and guiding these computational systems, audience participation, and agent behaviors through artist strategies. This framework is developed by analysing two categories of agent-based artworks, exploring the intersection of computational systems, audience participation, and artistic strategies in creating aesthetic experiences.

Currently, digital forensics discipline does not conduct the sort of validation testing needed to develop statistical confidence in tool performance, or to generate the empirical data needed to bring objectivity to examiner conclusions. Recently recommended standards provide more reliable results, and tool testing programs provide a better understanding of tools' limitations. However, these efforts do not constitute testing over the full range of expected target device conditions, product functionality, and target device configurations which are needed for validation testing. Several major impediments to validation testing include a lack of validation methods, a lack of reference data, and a lack of the definitional precision and low-level specificity needed to establish a system of measurement in digital forensics. This study attempts to identify the remaining needs that prevent comprehensive validation in digital forensics and identify potential solutions to address those needs.

In particular, we highlight how the theoretical literature on interbank networks offers a coherent way of studying interconnections, contagion processes and systemic risk, while emphasizing at the same time the challenges that must be addressed before general results on the link between the structure of the interbank network and financial stability can be established.

Multiplex networks include social networks, transportation networks or biological networks in the cell or in the brain. Extracting relevant information from these networks is of crucial importance for solving challenging inference problems and for characterizing the multiplex networks microscopic and mesoscopic structure. Here we propose an information theory method to extract the network between the layers of multiplex datasets, forming a "network of networks". We build an indicator function, based on the entropy of network ensembles, to characterize the mesoscopic similarities between the layers of a multiplex network and we use clustering techniques to characterize the communities present in this network of networks. We apply the proposed method to study the Multiplex Collaboration Network formed by scientists collaborating on different subjects and publishing in the Americal Physical Society (APS) journals. The analysis of this dataset reveals the interplay between the collaboration networks and the organization of knowledge in physics.},

  abstract = {Temporal regularities in speech, such as interdependencies in the timing of speech events, are thought to scaffold early acquisition of the building blocks in speech. By providing on-line clues to the location and duration of upcoming syllables, temporal structure may aid segmentation and clustering of continuous speech into separable units. This hypothesis tacitly assumes that learners exploitpredictabilityin the temporal structure of speech. Existing measures of speech timing tend to focus on first-order regularities among adjacent units, and are overly sensitive to idiosyncrasies in the data they describe. Here, we compare several statistical methods on a sample of 18 languages, testing whether syllable occurrence is predictable over time. Rather than looking for differences between languages, we aim to find across languages (using clearly defined acoustic, rather than orthographic, measures), temporal predictability in the speech signal which could be exploited by a language learner. First, we analyse distributional regularities using two novel techniques: a Bayesian ideal learner analysis, and a simple distributional measure. Second, we modelhigher-ordertemporal structure-regularities arising in an orderedseriesof syllable timings-testing the hypothesis that non-adjacent temporal structures may explain the gap between subjectively-perceived temporal regularities, and the absence of universally-accepted lower-order objective measures. Together, our analyses provide limited evidence for predictability at different time scales, though higher-order predictability is difficult to reliably infer. We conclude that temporal predictability in speech may well arise from a combination of individually weak perceptual cues at multiple structural levels, but is challenging to pinpoint.},

This is primarily because of the emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps underappreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentifiability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so-called label switching in the MCMC output. This means that ergodic averages of component specific quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artificial identifiability constraints, relabelling algorithms and label invariant loss functions. We also review various MCMC sampling schemes that have been suggested for mixture models and discuss posterior sensitivity to prior specification.},

The networks have between zero and four hidden layers, either \${\textbackslash}tanh\$ or \$ReLU\$ activation functions, and with and without hierarchical priors. The ensembles of BNNs are obtained by determining the posterior distribution over networks, from the posterior samples of individual BNNs re-weighted by the associated Bayesian evidence values. There is good correlation between out-of-sample performance and evidence, as well as a remarkable symmetry between the evidence versus model size and out-of-sample performance versus model size planes. Networks with \$ReLU\$ activation functions have consistently higher evidences than those with \${\textbackslash}tanh\$ functions, and this is reflected in their out-of-sample performance. Ensembling over architectures acts to further improve performance relative to the individual BNNs.},

  abstract = {In decision theory, mathematical analysis shows that once the sampling distribution, loss function, and sample are specified, the only remaining basis for a choice among different admissible decisions lies in the prior probabilities. Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called "subjectiveness") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional "direct probability" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an "invariant measure" on the parameter space.},

The net result is that no evidence whatsoever is offered to substantiate the claim of superiority of the orthodox method.To correct this situation we exhibit the Bayesian and orthodox solutions to six common statistical problems involving confidence intervals (including significance tests based on the same reasoning). In every case, we find that the situation is exactly the opposite; i.e., the Bayesian method is easier to apply and yields the same or better results. Indeed, the orthodox results are satisfactory only when they agree closely (or exactly) with the Bayesian results. No contrary example has yet been produced.By a refinement of the orthodox statistician's own criterion of performance, the best confidence interval for any location or scale parameter is proved to be the Bayesian posterior probability interval. In the cases of point estimation and hypothesis testing, similar proofs have long been known. We conclude that orthodox claims of superiority are totally unjustified; today, the original statistical methods of Bayes and Laplace stand in a position of proven superiority in actual performance, that places them beyond the reach of mere ideological or philosophical attacks. It is the continued teaching and use of orthodox methods that is in need of justification and defense.},

We conclude that: 1) "Orthodox" sampling theory methods are useful in problems where we have a known model (sampling distribution) for the properties of the noise, but no appreciable prior information about the quantities being estimated. 2) MAXENT is optimal in problems where we have prior information about multiplicities, but no noise. 3) The full Bayesian solution includes both of these as special cases and is needed in problems where we have both prior information and noise. 4) AR models are in one sense a special case of MAXENT, but in another sense they are ubiquitous in all spectral analysis problems with discrete time series. 5) Empirical methods such as Blackman-Tukey, which do not invoke even a likelihood function, are useful in the preliminary, exploratory phase of a problem where our knowledge is sufficient to permit intuitive judgments about how to organize a calculation (smoothing, decimation, windows, prewhitening, padding with zeroes, etc.) but insufficient to set up a quantitative model which would do the proper things for us automatically and optimally.},

Two types of structured matrices arise, herein termed, ``checkerboard'' and ``outer-banded''. Examples are presented. Properties of these structured matrices are explored and a full characterization of checkerboard matrices is given. The inverse eigenvalue problem is solved within the class of odd checkerboard matrices. In addition the ``symmetric-spectrum'' inverse eigenvalue problem is solved within a subclass of Hankel matrices. A regularity conjecture of H. Landau for the Toeplitz inverse eigenvalue problem is discussed and a similar conjecture for checkerboard Toeplitz matrices is given.},

We present a number of examples of graphical models, including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine, and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational algorithms can be formulated in each case.},

  abstract = {Speech production can be regarded as a process where a time-varying vocal tract system (filter) is excited by a time-varying excitation. In addition to its linguistic message, the speech signal also carries information about, for example, the gender and age of the speaker. Moreover, the speech signal includes acoustical cues about several speaker traits, such as the emotional state and the state of health of the speaker. In order to understand the production of these acoustical cues by the human speech production mechanism and utilize this information in speech technology, it is necessary to extract features describing both the excitation and the filter of the human speech production mechanism. While the methods to estimate and parameterize the vocal tract system are well established, the excitation appears less studied. This article provides a review of signal processing approaches used for the extraction of excitation information from speech. This article highlights the importance of excitation information in the analysis and classification of phonation type and vocal emotions, in the analysis of nonverbal laughter sounds, and in studying pathological voices. Furthermore, recent developments of deep learning techniques in the context of extraction and utilization of the excitation information are discussed.},

  abstract = {Formant tracking is an area of speech science that has recently undergone a technology shift from classical model-driven signal processing methods to modern data-driven deep learning methods. In this study, these two domains are combined in formant tracking by refining the formants estimated by a data-driven deep neural network (DNN) with formant estimates given by a model-driven linear prediction (LP) method. In the refinement process, the three lowest formants, initially estimated by the DNN-based method, are frame-wise replaced with local spectral peaks identified by the LP method. The LP-based refinement stage can be seamlessly integrated into the DNN without any training. As an LP method, the study advocates the use of quasiclosed phase forward-backward (QCP-FB) analysis. Three spectral representations are compared as DNN inputs: mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), the spectrogram, and the complex spectrogram. Formant tracking performance was evaluated by comparing the proposed refined DNN tracker with seven reference trackers, which included both signal processing and deep learning based methods. As evaluation data, ground truth formants of the Vocal Tract Resonance (VTR) corpus were used. The results demonstrate that the refined DNN trackers outperformed all conventional trackers. The best results were obtained by using the MFCC input for the DNN. The proposed MFCC refinement (MFCC-DNNQCP-FB) reduced estimation errors by 0.8 Hz, 12.9 Hz, and 11.7 Hz for the first (F1), second (F2), and third (F3) formants, respectively, compared to the Deep Formants refinement (DeepFQCP-FB). When compared to the model-driven KARMA tracking method, the proposed refinement reduced estimation errors by 2.3 Hz, 55.5 Hz, and 143.4 Hz for F1, F2, and F3, respectively. A detailed evaluation across various phonetic categories and gender groups showed that the proposed hybrid refinement approach improves formanttracking performance across most test conditions.},

Simpson's rule is less efficient in full area integration. Theoretical conclusions are illustrated by digital simulation and processing of experimental data. It was shown that for Gaussian peak Trapezoidal rule requires 0.62 points per standard deviation (2.5 points per peak width at baseline) to achieve integration error of only 0.1\%, while Simpson's rule requires 1.8 times higher data rates. Asymmetric peaks require higher data rates as well. Reasons of poor behavior of Simpson's rule are discussed; averaged Simpson's rules are constructed, these rules coincide with those based on Euler-Maclaurin formula. Euler-Maclaurin rules can reduce error in the case of partial peak integration. Higher peak moments (average retention time, dispersion, skewness, etc.) also exhibit extraordinary low errors and can potentially be used for evaluation of peak shape.},

If F0 were known in advance, then the spectral envelope could be estimated very reliably. On the other hand, if the spectral envelope were known in advance, then we could obtain a reliable F0 estimate. F0 and the spectral envelope, each of which is a prerequisite of the other, should thus be estimated jointly rather than independently in succession. On this basis, we develop a parametric speech spectrum model that allows us to estimate the F0 and spectral envelope simultaneously. We confirmed experimentally the significant advantage of this joint estimation approach for both F0 estimation and spectral envelope estimation.},

Most approaches lie at methodological extremes: some use probabilistic Bayesian models with convergence guarantees, while others opt for more efficient heuristic techniques. Despite competitive performance in previous work, the full Bayesian approach is difficult to scale to large speech corpora. We introduce an approximation to a recent Bayesian model that still has a clear objective function but improves efficiency by using hard clustering and segmentation rather than full Bayesian inference. Like its Bayesian counterpart, this embedded segmental K-means model (ES-KMeans) represents arbitrary-length word segments as fixed-dimensional acoustic word embeddings. We first compare ES-KMeans to previous approaches on common English and Xitsonga data sets (5 and 2.5 hours of speech): ES-KMeans outperforms a leading heuristic method in word segmentation, giving similar scores to the Bayesian model while being 5 times faster with fewer hyperparameters. However, its clusters are less pure than those of the other models. We then show that ES-KMeans scales to larger corpora by applying it to the 5 languages of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017 (up to 45 hours), where it performs competitively compared to the challenge baseline.},

Interbank market stability Granger causes the interbank market struc- ture, while the opposite causality is rejected. This emboldens the case for viewing the interbank market structure as endogenous. The results corroborate the thesis that prudential regulation at individual bank level is insu¬¢ cient to prevent systemic crises. We demonstrate that liquidity injections of a classical LOLR can e¬§ectively mitigate coordination fail- ures on the interbank market not only in theory, but also in practice. In short: liquidity matters.},

Here we demonstrate how the generalization of blockmodels to incorporate this missing element leads to an improved objective function for community detection in complex networks. We also propose a heuristic algorithm for community detection using this objective function or its non-degree-corrected counterpart and show that the degree-corrected version dramatically outperforms the uncorrected one in both real-world and synthetic networks.},

Applied statisticians who are new to these methods may have several questions and concerns, however: How much effort and expertise are needed to design and use a Markov chain sampler? How much confidence can one have in the answers that MCMC produces? How does the use of MCMC affect the rest of the model-building process? At the Joint Statistical Meetings in August, 1996, a panel of experienced MCMC users discussed these and other issues, as well as various ``tricks of the trade'' This article is an edited recreation of that discussion. Its purpose is to offer advice and guidance to novice users of MCMC---and to not-so-novice users as well. Topics include building confidence in simulation results, methods for speeding and assessing convergence, estimating standard errors, identification of models for which good MCMC algorithms exist, and the current state of software development.},

CARMA models fully account for irregular sampling and measurement errors, making them valuable for quantifying variability, forecasting and interpolating light curves, and for variability-based classification. We show that the PSD of a CARMA model can be expressed as a sum of Lorentzian functions, which makes them extremely flexible and able to model a broad range of PSDs. We present the likelihood function for light curves sampled from CARMA processes, placing them on a statistically rigorous foundation, and we present a Bayesian method to infer the probability distribution of the PSD given the measured lightcurve. Because calculation of the likelihood function scales linearly with the number of data points, CARMA modeling scales to current and future massive time-domain data sets. We conclude by applying our CARMA modeling approach to light curves for an X-ray binary, two AGN, a long-period variable star, and an RR-Lyrae star, in order to illustrate their use, applicability, and interpretation.},

The key idea in deriving such algorithms is to approximate the posterior using candidate distributions estimated by using natural gradients. Different candidate distributions result in different algorithms and further approximations to natural gradients give rise to variants of those algorithms.

Such systems include multiple subsystems and layers of connectivity, and it is important to take such 'multilayer' features into account to try to improve our understanding of complex systems. Consequently, it is necessary to generalize 'traditional' network theory by developing (and validating) a framework and associated tools to study multilayer systems in a comprehensive fashion. The origins of such efforts date back several decades and arose in multiple disciplines, and now the study of multilayer networks has become one of the most important directions in network science. In this paper, we discuss the history of multilayer networks (and related concepts) and review the exploding body of work on such networks. To unify the disparate terminology in the large body of recent work, we discuss a general framework for multilayer networks, construct a dictionary of terminology to relate the numerous existing concepts to each other and provide a thorough discussion that compares, contrasts and translates between related notions such as multilayer networks, multiplex networks, interdependent networks, networks of networks and many others. We also survey and discuss existing data sets that can be represented as multilayer networks. We review attempts to generalize single-layer-network diagnostics to multilayer networks. We also discuss the rapidly expanding research on multilayer-network models and notions like community structure, connected components, tensor decompositions and various types of dynamical processes on multilayer networks. We conclude with a summary and an outlook.},

The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty.The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning series},

Here, we explore alternative objectives for pretraining LMs in a way that also guides them to generate text aligned with human preferences. We benchmark five objectives for pretraining with human feedback across three tasks and study how they affect the trade-off between alignment and capabilities of pretrained LMs. We find a Pareto-optimal and simple approach among those we explored: conditional training, or learning distribution over tokens conditional on their human preference scores given by a reward model. Conditional training reduces the rate of undesirable content by up to an order of magnitude, both when generating without a prompt and with an adversarially-chosen prompt. Moreover, conditional training maintains the downstream task performance of standard LM pretraining, both before and after task-specific finetuning. Pretraining with human feedback results in much better preference satisfaction than standard LM pretraining followed by finetuning with feedback, i.e., learning and then unlearning undesirable behavior. Our results suggest that we should move beyond imitation learning when pretraining LMs and incorporate human preferences from the start of training.},

This paper investigates LLMs' behavior with respect to gender stereotypes, a known issue for prior models. We use a simple paradigm to test the presence of gender bias, building on but differing from WinoBias, a commonly used gender bias dataset, which is likely to be included in the training data of current LLMs. We test four recently published LLMs and demonstrate that they express biased assumptions about men and women's occupations. Our contributions in this paper are as follows: (a) LLMs are 3-6 times more likely to choose an occupation that stereotypically aligns with a person's gender; (b) these choices align with people's perceptions better than with the ground truth as reflected in official job statistics; (c) LLMs in fact amplify the bias beyond what is reflected in perceptions or the ground truth; (d) LLMs ignore crucial ambiguities in sentence structure 95\% of the time in our study items, but when explicitly prompted, they recognize the ambiguity; (e) LLMs provide explanations for their choices that are factually inaccurate and likely obscure the true reason behind their predictions. That is, they provide rationalizations of their biased behavior. This highlights a key property of these models: LLMs are trained on imbalanced datasets; as such, even with the recent successes of reinforcement learning with human feedback, they tend to reflect those imbalances back at us. As with other types of societal biases, we suggest that LLMs must be carefully tested to ensure that they treat minoritized individuals and communities equitably.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Many researchers have studied the acoustics, physiology, and perceptual characteristics of the voice source, but despite significant attention, it remains unclear which aspects of the source should be quantified and how measurements should be made. In this study, the authors examined the relationships among a number of existing measures of the glottal source spectrum, along with the association of these measures to overall spectral shapes and to glottal pulse shapes, to determine which measures of the source best capture information about the shapes of glottal pulses and glottal source spectra. Method: Seventy-eight different measures of source spectral shapes were made on the voices of 70 speakers. Principal components analysis was applied to measurement data, and the resulting factors were compared with factors similarly derived from oral speech spectra and glottal pulses. Results: Results revealed high levels of duplication and overlap among existing measures of source spectral slope. Further, existing measures were not well aligned with patterns of spectral variability. In particular, existing spectral measures do not appear to model the higher frequency parts of the source spectrum adequately. Conclusion: The failure of existing measures to adequately quantify spectral variability may explain why results of studies examining the perceptual importance of spectral slope have not produced consistent results. Because variability in the speech signal is often perceptually salient, these results suggest that most existing measures of source spectral slope are unlikely to be good predictors of voice quality.},

  abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs are the basic representation of the structure underlying Bayesian networks, which represent multivariate probability distributions. In many practical applications, such as the reverse engineering of gene regulatory networks, not only the estimation of model parameters but the reconstruction of the structure itself is of great interest. As well as for the assessment of different structure learning algorithms in simulation studies, a~uniform sample from the space of directed acyclic graphs is required to evaluate the prevalence of certain structural features. Here we analyse how to sample acyclic digraphs uniformly at random through recursive enumeration, an approach previously thought too computationally involved. Based on complexity considerations, we discuss in particular how the enumeration directly provides an exact method, which avoids the convergence issues of the alternative Markov chain methods and is actually computationally much faster. The limiting behaviour of the distribution of acyclic digraphs then allows us to sample arbitrarily large graphs. Building on the ideas of recursive enumeration based sampling we also introduce a novel hybrid Markov chain with much faster convergence than current alternatives while still being easy to adapt to various restrictions. Finally we discuss how to include such restrictions in the combinatorial enumeration and the new hybrid Markov chain method for efficient uniform sampling of the corresponding graphs.},

It is commonly implied that there is such a thing as a complex system, different examples of which are studied across many disciplines. However, there is no concise definition of a complex system, let alone a definition on which all scientists agree. We review various attempts to characterize a complex system, and consider a core set of features that are widely associated with complex systems in the literature and by those in the field. We argue that some of these features are neither necessary nor sufficient for complexity, and that some of them are too vague or confused to be of any analytical use. In order to bring mathematical rigour to the issue we then review some standard measures of complexity from the scientific literature, and offer a taxonomy for them, before arguing that the one that best captures the qualitative notion of the order produced by complex systems is that of the Statistical Complexity. Finally, we offer our own list of necessary conditions as a characterization of complexity. These conditions are qualitative and may not be jointly sufficient for complexity. We close with some suggestions for future work.},

The values of the parameters C and B for different sampling frequencies and radiation areas are found by minimizing the mean square error (MSE) between the modelled and the acoustic impedance. Owing to the sine and cosine functions used, the modelled impedance can be transformed exactly and straightforwardly into the z-domain. The third model described is a pole-zero-model, the parameters of which are also optimized by MSE-criterion. The limits for acceptable errors of the modelled impedances are studied and the models compared to the well known Flanagan's model.},

Furthermore, only one projection procedure for the univariate case was recently constructed, and no estimation procedures are available. By expanding the densities of multivariate generalized gamma convolutions into a tensorized Laguerre basis, we bridge the gap and provide performant estimation procedures for both the univariate and multivariate cases. We provide some insights about performance of these procedures, and a convergent series for the density of multivariate gamma convolutions, which is shown to be more stable than Moschopoulos's and Mathai's univariate series. We furthermore discuss some examples.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a framework for Bayesian inference that can offer principled uncertainty estimates for a large range of problems. For example, if we consider regression problems with Gaussian likelihoods, a GP model enjoys a posterior in closed form. However, identifying the posterior GP scales cubically with the number of training examples and requires to store all examples in memory. In order to overcome these obstacles, sparse GPs have been proposed that approximate the true posterior GP with pseudo-training examples. Importantly, the number of pseudo-training examples is user-defined and enables control over computational and memory complexity. In the general case, sparse GPs do not enjoy closed-form solutions and one has to resort to approximate inference. In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is variational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as an optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log marginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework, where pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the approximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters of the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can naturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from regression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification problems with discrete labels, but also problems with multidimensional labels. The purpose of this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for readers without prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the subject enables also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted VI as well as interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an inspiration for new research ideas.},

In fact, it is easily shown that the existing theory has many inherent contradictions and verifiably false claims. In this paper, we propose a new, mathematically precise, and structural definition of the extent to which a graph is scale-free, and prove a series of results that recover many of the claimed properties while suggesting the potential for a rich and interesting theory. With this definition, scale-free (or its opposite, scale-rich) is closely related to other structural graph properties such as various notions of self-similarity (or respectively, self-dissimilarity). Scale-free graphs are also shown to be the likely outcome of random construction processes, consistent with the heuristic definitions implicit in existing random graph approaches. Our approach clarifies much of the confusion surrounding the sensational qualitative claims in the scale-free literature, and offers rigorous and quantitative alternatives.},

The latter work proposed to use existing Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate ``textbook quality" data as a way to enhance the learning process compared to traditional web data. We follow the ``Textbooks Are All You Need" approach, focusing this time on common sense reasoning in natural language, and create a new 1.3 billion parameter model named {\textbackslash}textbf\{phi-1.5\}, with performance on natural language tasks comparable to models 5x larger, and surpassing most non-frontier LLMs on more complex reasoning tasks such as grade-school mathematics and basic coding. More generally, {\textbackslash}textbf\{phi-1.5\} exhibits many of the traits of much larger LLMs, both good -- such as the ability to ``think step by step" or perform some rudimentary in-context learning -- and bad, including hallucinations and the potential for toxic and biased generations -- encouragingly though, we are seeing improvement on that front thanks to the absence of web data. We open-source {\textbackslash}textbf\{phi-1.5\} to promote further research on these urgent topics.},

Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3{\textbackslash}\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.

Comparisons use six modern speech corpora with vocabularies ranging from 10 to more than 65,000 words and content ranging from read isolated words to spontaneous conversations. Error rates of machines are often more than an order of magnitude greater than those of humans for quiet, wideband, read speech. Machine performance degrades further below that of humans in noise, with channel variability, and for spontaneous speech. Humans can also recognize quiet, clearly spoken nonsense syllables and nonsense sentences with little high-level grammatical information. These comparisons suggest that the human-machine performance gap can be reduced by basic research on improving low-level acoustic-phonetic modeling, on improving robustness with noise and channel variability, and on more accurately modeling spontaneous speech.

Here we introduce a multicomponent, variable dimension, parametrized model to describe the Gaussian-noise power spectrum for data from ground-based gravitational wave interferometers. Called BayesLine, the algorithm models the noise power spectral density using cubic splines for smoothly varying broadband noise and Lorentzians for narrow-band line features in the spectrum. We describe the algorithm and demonstrate its performance on data from the fifth and sixth LIGO science runs. Once fully integrated into LIGO/Virgo data analysis software, BayesLine will produce accurate spectral estimation and provide a means for marginalizing inferences drawn from the data over all plausible noise spectra.},

The linear vocal tract model is well justified biomechanically, and linear prediction is a simple and well understood signal processing task. However, it has been established that, in voiced sounds, the vocal folds exhibit a high degree of nonlinearity. Hence there exists the need for an approach to modelling the behaviour of the vocal folds. This paper presents a simple, nonlinear, biophysical vocal fold model. A complementary discrete model is derived that reflects accurately the energy dynamics in the continuous model. This model can be implemented easily on standard digital signal processing hardware, and it is formulated in such a way that a simple form of nonlinear prediction can be carried out on vocal fold signals. This model could be of utility in many speech technological applications where low computational complexity synthesis and analysis of vocal fold dynamics is required.},

The test provides robust evidence undermining the validity of these linear techniques, supporting the assumptions of either dynamical nonlinearity and/or non-Gaussianity common to more recent, complex, efforts at dynamical modelling speech time series. However, an additional finding is that the classical assumptions cannot be ruled out entirely, and plausible evidence is given to explain the success of the linear Gaussian theory as a weak approximation to the true, nonlinear/non-Gaussian dynamics. This supports the use of appropriate hybrid linear/nonlinear/non-Gaussian modelling. With a calibrated calculation of statistic and particular choice of experimental protocol, some of the known systematic problems of the method of surrogate data testing are circumvented to obtain results to support the conclusions to a high level of significance.},

  abstract = {Background: Voice disorders affect patients profoundly, and acoustic tools can potentially measure voice function objectively. Disordered sustained vowels exhibit wide-ranging phenomena, from nearly periodic to highly complex, aperiodic vibrations, and increased ``breathiness''. Modelling and surrogate data studies have shown significant nonlinear and non-Gaussian random properties in these sounds. Nonetheless, existing tools are limited to analysing voices displaying near periodicity, and do not account for this inherent biophysical nonlinearity and non-Gaussian randomness, often using linear signal processing methods insensitive to these properties. They do not directly measure the two main biophysical symptoms of disorder: complex nonlinear aperiodicity, and turbulent, aeroacoustic, non-Gaussian randomness. Often these tools cannot be applied to more severe disordered voices, limiting their clinical usefulness. Methods: This paper introduces two new tools to speech analysis: recurrence and fractal scaling, which overcome the range limitations of existing tools by addressing directly these two symptoms of disorder, together reproducing a ``hoarseness'' diagram. A simple bootstrapped classifier then uses these two features to distinguish normal from disordered voices.},

Next, we explore the consequences of relaxing the assumptions of time-invariance and Gaussianity, which admits certain potentially useful techniques, including wavelet and sparse representations in computational harmonic analysis, but rules out Fourier analysis and convolution, which could be a disadvantage. Then, we focus on methods that retain time-invariance alone, which admits techniques from nonlinear time series analysis and Markov chains, both of which have shown promise in biomedical applications. We highlight recent examples of non-LTI-Gaussian digital speech signal processing in the literature, and draw conclusions for future prospects in this area.},

Although control theory offers mathematical tools for steering engineered and natural systems towards a desired state, a framework to control complex self-organized systems is lacking. Here we develop analytical tools to study the controllability of an arbitrary complex directed network, identifying the set of driver nodes with time-dependent control that can guide the system's entire dynamics. We apply these tools to several real networks, finding that the number of driver nodes is determined mainly by the network's degree distribution. We show that sparse inhomogeneous networks, which emerge in many real complex systems, are the most difficult to control, but that dense and homogeneous networks can be controlled using a few driver nodes. Counterintuitively, we find that in both model and real systems the driver nodes tend to avoid the high-degree nodes.},

The traditional method to trace back states is called checkpointing that stores intermediate states into a global stack and restore state through either stack pop or re-computing. The overhead of stack manipulations and re-computing makes the general purposed (not tensor-based) AD engines unable to meet many industrial needs. Instead of checkpointing, we propose to use reverse computing to trace back states by designing and implementing a reversible programming eDSL, where a program can be executed bi-directionally without implicit stack operations. The absence of implicit stack operations makes the program compatible with existing compiler features, including utilizing existing optimization passes and compiling the code as GPU kernels. We implement AD for sparse matrix operations and some machine learning applications to show that our framework has the state-of-the-art performance.},

  abstract = {Adding inequality constraints (e.g. boundedness, monotonicity, convexity) into Gaussian processes (GPs) can lead to more realistic stochastic emulators. Due to the truncated Gaussianity of the posterior, its distribution has to be approximated. In this work, we consider Monte Carlo (MC) and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. However, strictly interpolating the observations may entail expensive computations due to highly restrictive sample spaces. Furthermore, having (constrained) GP emulators when data are actually noisy is also of interest for real-world implementations. Hence, we introduce a noise term for the relaxation of the interpolation conditions, and we develop the corresponding approximation of GP emulators under linear inequality constraints. We show with various toy examples that the performance of MC and MCMC samplers improves when considering noisy observations. Finally, on 2D and 5D coastal flooding applications, we show that more flexible and realistic GP implementations can be obtained by considering noise effects and by enforcing the (linear) inequality constraints.},

  abstract = {A physical self-learning machine can be defined as a nonlinear dynamical system that can be trained on data (similar to artificial neural networks) but where the update of the internal degrees of freedom that serve as learnable parameters happens autonomously. In this way, neither external processing and feedback nor knowledge of (and control of) these internal degrees of freedom is required. We introduce a general scheme for self-learning in any time-reversible Hamiltonian system. It relies on implementing a time-reversal operation and injecting a small error signal on top of the echo dynamics. We show how the physical dynamics itself will then lead to the required gradient update of learnable parameters, independent of the details of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the training of such a self-learning machine numerically for the case of coupled nonlinear wave fields and other examples.},

  abstract = {In most data-scientific approaches, the principle of Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) is used to a posteriori justify some parametric model which has been already chosen based on experience, prior knowledge or computational simplicity. In a perpendicular formulation to conventional model building, we start from the linear system of phenomenological constraints and asymptotically derive the distribution over all viable distributions that satisfy the provided set of constraints. The MaxEnt distribution plays a special role, as it is the most typical among all phenomenologically viable distributions representing a good expansion point for large-N techniques. This enables us to consistently formulate hypothesis testing in a fully-data driven manner. The appropriate parametric model which is supported by the data can be always deduced at the end of model selection. In the MaxEnt framework, we recover major scores and selection procedures used in multiple applications and assess their ability to capture associations in the data-generating process and identify the most generalizable model. This data-driven counterpart of standard model selection demonstrates the unifying prospective of the deductive logic advocated by MaxEnt principle, while potentially shedding new insights to the inverse problem.},

  abstract = {Computational models are a way of approaching research questions related to auditory perception. One relevant question is how we are able to follow and understand speech in complex acoustic scenes. Previous studies suggest that for tracking a speaker in such conditions, humans use (1) sparse, speaker-related bits of robust information - 'auditory glimpses' and (2) a mechanism of predictive coding with a movable locus of attention. The goal of the present study is to develop a computational model for attentive tracking of voices, which takes these two aspects into account. We model auditory glimpses using Glimpsed Periodicity Features and predictive coding using Recursive Bayesian Estimation. We assume that perception is organized into an attended foreground and unattended background. We propose parallel particle filters - one for each category - to track the concurrent events. In this approach, each incoming glimpse is associated with either foreground or background based on accumulated evidence. Simulations with artificially generated data of a 'glimpsing' nature (sparse, robust) showed that this approach is suitable to track multidimensional parameter trajectories of two competing sources. This suggests the potential of the method to track simultaneously active voices based on the Glimpsed Periodicity Features.},

The ontology defines digital objects and digitalized systems and grounds these constructs into fundamental claims about the nature of physical, mental, and social reality. To show the power of the ontology, we contrast it with the ontology used in a widely cited paper by Yoo et al. (2010). We show how our ontology leads to some different conclusions and predictions from theirs.

In recent years, they have been widely used for data visualization on planar domains and planar parameterization of open surfaces. However, the theory and computation of density-equalizing maps for closed surfaces are much less explored. In this work, we develop a novel method for computing spherical density-equalizing maps for genus-0 closed surfaces. Specifically, we first compute a conformal parameterization of the given genus-0 closed surface onto the unit sphere. Then, we perform density equalization on the spherical domain based on the given density information to achieve a spherical density-equalizing map. The bijectivity of the mapping is guaranteed using quasi-conformal theory. We further propose a method for incorporating the harmonic energy and landmark constraints into our formulation to achieve landmark-aligned spherical density-equalizing maps balancing different distortion measures. Using the proposed methods, a large variety of spherical parameterizations can be achieved. Applications to surface registration, remeshing, and data visualization are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates a weighted LPC analysis of voiced speech. In view of the speech production model, the weighting function is either chosen to be the short-time energy function of the preemphasized speech sample sequence with certain delays or is obtained by thresholding the short-time energy function. In this method, speech samples are selectively weighted based on how well they match the speech production model. Therefore, the estimates of the LPC coefficients obtained by this novel LPC analysis are more accurate than those obtained from the conventional LPC analysis. They are also less sensitive to the values of the fundamental frequency than conventional LPC.

  abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests voice dysfunction is the earliest sign of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD). The complexity and fine motor control involved in vocalization may result in dysfunction here before the limbs. The voice in PD demonstrates characteristic changes on perceptual and acoustic analyses. The physiological and anatomical correlates of these have been investigated through laryngoscopy, stroboscopy, photoglottography, laryngeal electromyography, computed-tomography, pulmonary function testing and aerodynamic assessments. These have revealed numerous abnormalities including incomplete glottic closure and vocal fold hypoadduction/bowing to account for these voice changes. Many of these phenomena are likely related to rigidity or bradykinesia of the laryngeal muscles. The early onset of voice changes is resonant with the pathophysiological insights offered by Braak's hypothesis and murine models of the disease. These physiological abnormalities and pathological models largely stand to support dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic mechanisms being implicated in the pathogenesis of voice dysfunction. This review focuses on characterizing the voice changes in PD. These stand as a promising area of enquiry to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and offer potential to be utilized as an early diagnostic biomarker or marker of disease progression.},

  abstract = {The Bayesian framework for model comparison and regularisation is demonstrated by studying interpolation and classification problems modelled with both linear and non-linear models. This framework quantitatively embodies 'Occam's razor'. Over-complex and under-regularised models are automatically inferred to be less probable, even though their flexibility allows them to fit the data better. When applied to 'neural networks', the Bayesian framework makes possible (1) objective comparison of solutions using alternative network architectures; (2) objective stopping rules for network pruning or growing procedures; (3) objective choice of type of weight decay terms (or regularisers); (4) on-line techniques for optimising weight decay (or regularisation constant) magnitude; (5) a measure of the effective number of well-determined parameters in a model; (6) quantified estimates of the error bars on network parameters and on network output. In the case of classification models, it is shown that the careful incorporation of error bar information into a classifier's predictions yields improved performance. Comparisons of the inferences of the Bayesian Framework with more traditional cross-validation methods help detect poor underlying assumptions in learning models. The relationship of the Bayesian learning framework to 'active learning' is examined. Objective functions are discussed which measure the expected informativeness data measurements, in the context of both interpolation and classification problems. The concepts and methods described in this thesis are quite general and will be applicable to other data modelling problems whether they involve regression, classification or density estimation.},

  abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure that is typically applied to a small number of independent objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined over many correlated outcomes (or ``tasks''). For example, scientists may want to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization. However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic surrogates for multi-task Bayesian optimization scale poorly with the number of outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform Bayesian optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that model solely the outcome metrics. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of applications for Bayesian optimization across a range of tasks in science and engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with 65,000 outputs.},

In particular, we show that, in the colored noise case, the amplitude information can also help improving the performance of the frequency estimator, and vice versa. We propose an efficient FFT-based implementation structure of the optimal estimators, which can be further simplified when the noise can be modeled as an AR process; besides, when the estimators cannot be expressed in closed form, we propose a simple univariate optimization algorithm in order to compute the estimates.

  abstract = {Networks (or graphs) appear as dominant structures in diverse domains, including sociology, biology, neuroscience and computer science. In most of the aforementioned cases graphs are directed - in the sense that there is directionality on the edges, making the semantics of the edges non symmetric. An interesting feature that real networks present is the clustering or community structure property, under which the graph topology is organized into modules commonly called communities or clusters. The essence here is that nodes of the same community are highly similar while on the contrary, nodes across communities present low similarity. Revealing the underlying community structure of directed complex networks has become a crucial and interdisciplinary topic with a plethora of applications. Therefore, naturally there is a recent wealth of research production in the area of mining directed graphs - with clustering being the primary method and tool for community detection and evaluation. The goal of this paper is to offer an in-depth review of the methods presented so far for clustering directed networks along with the relevant necessary methodological background and also related applications. The survey commences by offering a concise review of the fundamental concepts and methodological base on which graph clustering algorithms capitalize on. Then we present the relevant work along two orthogonal classifications. The first one is mostly concerned with the methodological principles of the clustering algorithms, while the second one approaches the methods from the viewpoint regarding the properties of a good cluster in a directed network. Further, we present methods and metrics for evaluating graph clustering results, demonstrate interesting application domains and provide promising future research directions.},

In this paper, we study the relationship between random, wide, fully connected, feedforward networks with more than one hidden layer and Gaussian processes with a recursive kernel definition. We show that, under broad conditions, as we make the architecture increasingly wide, the implied random function converges in distribution to a Gaussian process, formalising and extending existing results by Neal (1996) to deep networks. To evaluate convergence rates empirically, we use maximum mean discrepancy. We then compare finite Bayesian deep networks from the literature to Gaussian processes in terms of the key predictive quantities of interest, finding that in some cases the agreement can be very close. We discuss the desirability of Gaussian process behaviour and review non-Gaussian alternative models from the literature.},

  abstract = {An algorithm is presented which finds the frequency and amplitude of the first three formants during all vowel-like segments of continuous speech. It uses as input the peaks of the linear prediction spectra and a segmentation parameter to indicate energy and voicing. Ideally, the first three peaks are the first three formants. Frequently, however, two peaks merge, or spurious peaks appear, and the difficult part is to recognize such situations and deal with them. The general method is to fill formant slots with the available peaks at each frame, based on frequency position relative to an educated guess. Then, if a peak is left over and/or a slot is unfilled, special routines are called to decide how to deal with them. Included is a formant enhancement technique, analogous to a similar technique which has been implemented via the chirp-z transform [8], which usually succeeds in separating two merged formants. Processing begins at the middle of each high volume voiced segment, where formants are most likely to be correct, and branches outward from there in both directions in time, using the most recently found formant frequencies as the educated guess for the current frame. The algorithm has been implemented at Lincoln Laboratory on the Univac 1219 and the Fast Digital Processor, a programmable processor [9], and has been tested on a large number of unrestricted sentences.},

  abstract = {This book sets out to understand the structure of the human brain---the place where mind meets matter. Until recently, the left hemisphere of our brain has been seen as the 'rational' side, the superior partner to the right. Drawing on a vast body of experimental research, the book argues that while our left brain makes for a wonderful servant, it is a very poor master. As it shows, it is the right side which is the more reliable and insightful. Without it, our world would be mechanistic--stripped of depth, colour and value. The book tells a story about ourselves and the world, and about how we got to be where we are now. While much of it is about the structure of the human brain---the place where mind meets matter---ultimately it is an attempt to understand the structure of the world that the brain has in part created. The book is divided, like the brain it describes, into two parts. Part I, focuses on the brain itself, and what it can tell us. It looks at the evolution of the brain, its divided and asymmetrical nature, and the implications of the development of music and language, and what one knows about what goes on in each side of the brain. Part II of the book looks at the history of Western culture in the light of what is believed about the hemispheres. These thoughts are inevitably contingent, to some extent fragmentary and rudimental. But if the world is not independent of our observation of it attention to it and interaction with it and if the mind is at least mediated by the brain, it seems a reasonable bet that the brain will have left its mark on the world that one have brought about.

  abstract = {This survey reviews works in which language models (LMs) are augmented with reasoning skills and the ability to use tools. The former is defined as decomposing a potentially complex task into simpler subtasks while the latter consists in calling external modules such as a code interpreter. LMs can leverage these augmentations separately or in combination via heuristics, or learn to do so from demonstrations. While adhering to a standard missing tokens prediction objective, such augmented LMs can use various, possibly non-parametric external modules to expand their context processing ability, thus departing from the pure language modeling paradigm. We therefore refer to them as Augmented Language Models (ALMs). The missing token objective allows ALMs to learn to reason, use tools, and even act, while still performing standard natural language tasks and even outperforming most regular LMs on several benchmarks. In this work, after reviewing current advance in ALMs, we conclude that this new research direction has the potential to address common limitations of traditional LMs such as interpretability, consistency, and scalability issues.},

  abstract = {para This paper investigates the problem of speaker identification and verification in noisy conditions, assuming that speech signals are corrupted by environmental noise, but knowledge about the noise characteristics is not available. This research is motivated in part by the potential application of speaker recognition technologies on handheld devices or the Internet. While the technologies promise an additional biometric layer of security to protect the user, the practical implementation of such systems faces many challenges. One of these is environmental noise. Due to the mobile nature of such systems, the noise sources can be highly time-varying and potentially unknown. This raises the requirement for noise robustness in the absence of information about the noise. This paper describes a method that combines multicondition model training and missing-feature theory to model noise with unknown temporal-spectral characteristics. Multicondition training is conducted using simulated noisy data with limited noise variation, providing a \&ldquo;coarse\&rdquo; compensation for the noise, and missing-feature theory is applied to refine the compensation by ignoring noise variation outside the given training conditions, thereby reducing the training and testing mismatch. This paper is focused on several issues relating to the implementation of the new model for real-world applications. These include the generation of multicondition training data to model noisy speech, the combination of different training data to optimize the recognition performance, and the reduction of the model's complexity. The new algorithm was tested using two databases with simulated and realistic noisy speech data. The first database is a redevelopment of the TIMIT database by rerecording the data in the presence of various noise types, used to test the model for speaker identification with a focus on the varieties of noise. The second database is a handheld-device database collected in realisti- c noisy conditions, used to further validate the model for real-world speaker verification. The new model is compared to baseline systems and is found to achieve lower error rates. /para},

Our results indicate that incorporating TVs can significantly improve word recognition rates when used in conjunction with traditional acoustic features.},

For each of these tools, the precise context of their use is described. The second part of the paper is focused on the ways these tools have been used in data, signal and image processing and in the inverse problems, which arise in different physical sciences and engineering applications. A few examples of the applications are described: entropy in independent components analysis (ICA) and in blind source separation, Fisher information in data model selection, different maximum entropy-based methods in time series spectral estimation and in linear inverse problems and, finally, the Bayesian inference for general inverse problems. Some original materials concerning the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and, in particular, the variational Bayesian approximation (VBA) methods are also presented. VBA is used for proposing an alternative Bayesian computational tool to the classical Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We will also see that VBA englobes joint maximum a posteriori (MAP), as well as the different expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms as particular cases.},

In a nutshell, the contagion effects when considering the shock propagation simultaneously across multiple layers of interbank networks can be substantially larger than the sum of the contagion-induced losses when considering the network layers individually. In addition, a bank ``systemic importance'' measure based on the multi-layered network model is developed and is shown to outperform standard network centrality indicators.},

  journal = {Chemistry \& {\dots}},
  abstract = {Modelling sequential data is important in many areas of science and engineering. Hidden Markov models (HMMs) and Kalman filter models (KFMs) are popular for this because they are simple and flexible. For example, HMMs have been used for speech recognition and bio-sequence analysis, and KFMs have been used for problems ranging from tracking planes and missiles to predicting the economy. However, HMMs and KFMs are limited in their ``expressive power''. Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) generalize HMMs by allowing the state space to be represented in factored form, instead of as a single discrete random variable. DBNs generalize KFMs by allowing arbitrary probability distributions, not just (unimodal) linear-Gaussian. In this thesis, I will discuss how to represent many different kinds of models as DBNs, how to perform exact and approximate inference in DBNs, and how to learn DBN models from sequential data. In particular, the main novel technical contributions of this thesis are as follows: a way of representing Hierarchical HMMs as DBNs, which enables inference to be done in O(T) time instead of O(T 3), where T is the length of the sequence; an exact smoothing algorithm that takes O(log T) space instead of O(T); a simple way of using the junction tree algorithm for online inference in DBNs; new complexity bounds on exact online inference in DBNs; a new deterministic approximate inference algorithm called factored frontier; an analysis of the relationship between the BK algorithm and loopy belief propagation; a way of applying Rao-Blackwellised particle filtering to DBNs in general, and the SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) problem in particular; a way of extending the structural EM algorithm to DBNs; and a variety of different applications of DBNs. However, perhaps the main value of the thesis is its catholic presentation of the field of sequential data modelling. 1 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank my advisor, Stuart Russell, for supporting me over the years, and for giving me so much freedom to explore and discover new areas of probabilistic AI. My other committee members have also been very supportive. Michael Jordan has long been an inspiration to me. His classes and weekly meetings have proved to be one of my best learning experiences at Berkeley. Jeff Bilmes proved to be a most thorough reviewer, as I expected, and has kept me honest about all the details. Peter Bickel brought a useful outsider's perspective to the thesis, and encouraged me to make it more accessible to non computer scientists (although any failings in this regard are of course my fault). I would like to thank my many friends and colleagues at Berkeley with whom I have had the pleasure of working over the years. These include Eyal Amir, David Andre, Serge Belongie, Jeff Bilmes, Nancy Chang, Nando de Freitas, Nir Friedman, Paul Horton, Srini Narayanan, Andrew Ng, Mark Paskin, Sekhar Tatikonda, Yair Weiss, Erix Xing, Geoff Zweig, and all the members of the RUGS and IR groups. I would like to thank Jim Rehg for hiring me as an intern at DEC/Compaq/HP Cambridge Research Lab in 1997, where my Bayes Net Toolbox (BNT) was born. I would like to thank Gary Bradski for hiring me as an intern at Intel in 2000 to work on BNT, and for providing me with the opportunity to work with people spanning three countries formerly known as superpowers --- USA, China and Russia. In particular, I would like to thankWei Hu and Yimin Zhang, of ICRC, for their help with BNT. I would also like to thank the many people on the web who have contributed bug fixes to BNT. By chance, I was able to work with Sebastian Thrun during part of my time with Intel, for which I am very grateful. I would like to thank my friends in Jennie Nation and beyond for providing a welcome distraction from school. Finally, I would like to thank my wife Margaret for putting up with my weekends in the office, for listening to my sagas from Soda land, and for giving me the motivation to finish this thesis.},

DYPSA is automatic and operates using the speech signal alone without the need for an EGG signal. The algorithm employs the phase-slope function and a novel phase-slope projection technique for estimating GCI candidates from the speech signal. The most likely candidates are then selected using a dynamic programming technique to minimize a cost function that we define. We review and evaluate three existing methods of GCI estimation and compare the new DYPSA algorithm to them. Results are presented for the APLAWD and SAM databases for which 95.7\% and 93.1\% of GCIs are correctly identified.},

  abstract = {Markov chain sampling methods that adapt to characteristics of the distribution being sampled can be constructed using the principle that one can ample from a distribution by sampling uniformly from the region under the plot of its density function. A Markov chain that converges to this uniform distribution can be constructed by alternating uniform sampling in the vertical direction with uniform sampling from the horizontal "slice" defined by the current vertical position, or more generally, with some update that leaves the uniform distribution over this slice invariant. Such "slice sampling" methods are easily implemented for univariate distributions, and can be used to sample from a multivariate distribution by updating each variable in turn. This approach is often easier to implement than Gibbs sampling and more efficient than simple Metropolis updates, due to the ability of slice sampling to adaptively choose the magnitude of changes made. It is therefore attractive for routine and automated use. Slice sampling methods that update all variables simultaneously are also possible. These methods can adaptively choose the magnitudes of changes made to each variable, based on the local properties of the density function. More ambitiously, such methods could potentially adapt to the dependencies between variables by constructing local quadratic approximations. Another approach is to improve sampling efficiency by suppressing random walks. This can be done for univariate slice sampling by "overrelaxation," and for multivariate slice sampling by "reflection" from the edges of the slice.},

  abstract = {We propose and study a set of algorithms for discovering community structure in networks -- natural divisions of network nodes into densely connected subgroups. Our algorithms all share two definitive features: first, they involve iterative removal of edges from the network to split it into communities, the edges removed being identified using one of a number of possible "betweenness" measures, and second, these measures are, crucially, recalculated after each removal. We also propose a measure for the strength of the community structure found by our algorithms, which gives us an objective metric for choosing the number of communities into which a network should be divided. We demonstrate that our algorithms are highly effective at discovering community structure in both computer-generated and real-world network data, and show how they can be used to shed light on the sometimes dauntingly complex structure of networked systems.},

We consider mixing according to discrete characteristics such as language or race in social networks and scalar characteristics such as age. As a special example of the latter we consider mixing according to vertex degree, i.e., according to the number of connections vertices have to other vertices: do gregarious people tend to associate with other gregarious people? We propose a number of measures of assortative mixing appropriate to the various mixing types, and apply them to a variety of real-world networks, showing that assortative mixing is a pervasive phenomenon found in many networks. We also propose several models of assortatively mixed networks, both analytic ones based on generating function methods, and numerical ones based on Monte Carlo graph generation techniques. We use these models to probe the properties of networks as their level of assortativity is varied. In the particular case of mixing by degree, we find strong variation with assortativity in the connectivity of the network and in the resilience of the network to the removal of vertices.},

Here I show that the modularity can be expressed in terms of the eigenvectors of a characteristic matrix for the network, which I call the modularity matrix, and that this expression leads to a spectral algorithm for community detection that returns results of demonstrably higher quality than competing methods in shorter running times. I illustrate the method with applications to several published network data sets.},

  abstract = {Objective To study the feasibility of using acoustic signatures in snore signals for the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Methods Snoring sounds of 30 apneic snorers (24 males; 6 females; apnea--hypopnea index, AHI=46.9{\textpm}25.7events/h) and 10 benign snorers (6 males; 4 females; AHI=4.6{\textpm}3.4events/h) were captured in a sleep laboratory. The recorded snore signals were preprocessed to remove noise, and subsequently, modeled using a linear predictive coding (LPC) technique. Formant frequencies (F1, F2, and F3) were extracted from the LPC spectrum for analysis. The accuracy of this approach was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and notched box plots. The relationship between AHI and F1 was further explored via regression analysis. Results Quantitative differences in formant frequencies between apneic and benign snores are found in same- or both-gender snorers. Apneic snores exhibit higher formant frequencies than benign snores, especially F1, which can be related to the pathology of OSA. This study yields a sensitivity of 88\%, a specificity of 82\%, and a threshold value of F1=470Hz that best differentiate apneic snorers from benign snorers (both gender combined). Conclusion Acoustic signatures in snore signals carry information for OSA diagnosis, and snore-based analysis might potentially be a non-invasive and inexpensive diagnostic approach for mass screening of OSA.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic models are conceptually powerful tools for finding structure in data, but their practical effectiveness is often limited by our ability to perform inference in them. Exact inference is frequently intractable, so approximate inference is often performed using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). To achieve the best possible results from MCMC, we want to efficiently simulate many steps of a rapidly mixing Markov chain which leaves the target distribution invariant. Of particular interest in this regard is how to take advantage of multi-core computing to speed up MCMC-based inference, both to improve mixing and to distribute the computational load. In this paper, we present a parallelizable Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for efficiently sampling from continuous probability distributions that can take advantage of hundreds of cores. This method shares information between parallel Markov chains to build a scale-mixture of Gaussians approximation to the density function of the target distribution. We combine this approximation with a recent method known as elliptical slice sampling to create a Markov chain with no step-size parameters that can mix rapidly without requiring gradient or curvature computations.},

The acoustic axis of the ultrasound beam in conventional studies was parallel to the gravitational force, and the levitated objects were manipulated along the fixed axis (i.e. one-dimensionally) by controlling the phases or frequencies of bolted Langevin-type transducers. In the present study, we considered extended acoustic manipulation whereby millimetre-sized particles were levitated and moved three-dimensionally by localised ultrasonic standing waves, which were generated by ultrasonic phased arrays. Our manipulation system has two original features. One is the direction of the ultrasound beam, which is arbitrary because the force acting toward its centre is also utilised. The other is the manipulation principle by which a localised standing wave is generated at an arbitrary position and moved three-dimensionally by opposed and ultrasonic phased arrays. We experimentally confirmed that expanded-polystyrene particles of 0.6 mm, 1 mm, and 2 mm in diameter could be manipulated by our proposed method.},

A network histogram is obtained by fitting a stochastic blockmodel to a single observation of a network dataset. Blocks of edges play the role of histogram bins, and community sizes that of histogram bandwidths or bin sizes. Just as standard histograms allow for varying bandwidths, different blockmodel estimates can all be considered valid representations of an underlying probability model, subject to bandwidth constraints. Here we provide methods for automatic bandwidth selection, by which the network histogram approximates the generating mechanism that gives rise to exchangeable random graphs. This makes the blockmodel a universal network representation for unlabeled graphs. With this insight, we discuss the interpretation of network communities in light of the fact that many different community assignments can all give an equally valid representation of such a network. To demonstrate the fidelity-versus-interpretability tradeoff inherent in considering different numbers and sizes of communities, we analyze two publicly available networks - political weblogs and student friendships - and discuss how to interpret the network histogram when additional information related to node and edge labeling is present.},

  abstract = {Developing speech technologies for low-resource languages has become a very active research field over the last decade. Among others, Bayesian models have shown some promising results on artificial examples but still lack of in situ experiments. Our work applies state-of-the-art Bayesian models to unsupervised Acoustic Unit Discovery (AUD) in a real low-resource language scenario. We also show that Bayesian models can naturally integrate information from other resourceful languages by means of informative prior leading to more consistent discovered units. Finally, discovered acoustic units are used, either as the I-best sequence or as a lattice, to perform word segmentation. Word segmentation results show that this Bayesian approach clearly outperforms a Segmental-DTW baseline on the same corpus.},

Our approach may be described by the following two steps procedure: first the model learns the notion of acoustic units from the labelled data and then the model uses its knowledge to find new acoustic units on the target language. We implement this process with the Bayesian Subspace Hidden Markov Model (SHMM), a model akin to the Subspace Gaussian Mixture Model (SGMM) where each low dimensional embedding represents an acoustic unit rather than just a HMM's state. The subspace is trained on 3 languages from the GlobalPhone corpus (German, Polish and Spanish) and the AUs are discovered on the TIMIT corpus. Results, measured in equivalent Phone Error Rate, show that this approach significantly outperforms previous HMM based acoustic units discovery systems and compares favorably with the Variational Auto Encoder-HMM.},

The model is fully probabilistic and autoregressive, with the predictive distribution for each audio sample conditioned on all previous ones; nonetheless we show that it can be efficiently trained on data with tens of thousands of samples per second of audio. When applied to text-to-speech, it yields state-ofthe-art performance, with human listeners rating it as significantly more natural sounding than the best parametric and concatenative systems for both English and Mandarin. A single WaveNet can capture the characteristics of many different speakers with equal fidelity, and can switch between them by conditioning on the speaker identity. When trained to model music, we find that it generates novel and often highly realistic musical fragments. We also show that it can be employed as a discriminative model, returning promising results for phoneme recognition.},

Through a literature review analyzing ten case studies, this paper highlights the nuances of using AI-driven tools in envisioning speculative futures. The paper investigates how AI influences speculative design approaches to identify the benefits, limitations, and potential challenges when combining the two. The results are presented according to the three most prominent themes identified across the ten articles: using AI for image generation, perceived accessibility of AI, and using AI to envision future scenarios. While using AI to automate parts of the design process is perceived as a significant benefit, some also regard the results produced by AI as uninspiring and needing more contextual factors. This is addressed in the discussion section, focusing on the challenges of AI-generated images. Lastly, this paper discusses the ambiguous terminology used about speculative design and what implications this could have for future research.},

It approximates a full posterior distribution with a factorized set of distributions by maximizing a lower bound on the marginal likelihood. This requires the ability to integrate a sum of terms in the log joint likelihood using this factorized distribution. Often not all integrals are in closed form, which is typically handled by using a lower bound. We present an alternative algorithm based on stochastic optimization that allows for direct optimization of the variational lower bound. This method uses control variates to reduce the variance of the stochastic search gradient, in which existing lower bounds can play an important role. We demonstrate the approach on two non-conjugate models: logistic regression and an approximation to the HDP.},

In this paper, we propose an approach called wide learning based on arc-cosine kernels, that learns a single layer of infinite width.

In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

On the other hand, when the number of edges is fixed, graphs with large cliques appear to minimize the entropy.},

Such multi-relational data can be represented as multi-layer graphs where the set of vertices represents the entities and multiple types of edges represent the different relations among them. For community detection in multi-layer graphs, we consider two random graph models, the multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (MLSBM) and a model with a restricted parameter space, the restricted multi-layer stochastic blockmodel (RMLSBM). We derive consistency results for community assignments of the maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) in both models where MLSBM is assumed to be the true model, and either the number of nodes or the number of types of edges or both grow. We compare MLEs in the two models with other baseline approaches, such as separate modeling of layers, aggregating the layers and majority voting. RMLSBM is shown to have advantage over MLSBM when either the growth rate of the number of communities is high or the growth rate of the average degree of the component graphs in the multi-graph is low. We also derive minimax rates of error and sharp thresholds for achieving consistency of community detection in both models, which are then used to compare the multi-layer models with a baseline model, the aggregate stochastic block model. The simulation studies and real data applications confirm the superior performance of the multi-layer approaches in comparison to the baseline procedures.},

  abstract = {A principled approach to characterize the hidden structure of networks is to formulate generative models, and then infer their parameters from data. When the desired structure is composed of modules or "communities", a suitable choice for this task is the stochastic block model (SBM), where nodes are divided into groups, and the placement of edges is conditioned on the group memberships. Here, we present a nonparametric Bayesian method to infer the modular structure of empirical networks, including the number of modules and their hierarchical organization. We focus on a microcanonical variant of the SBM, where the structure is imposed via hard constraints, i.e. the generated networks are not allowed to violate the patterns imposed by the model. We show how this simple model variation allows simultaneously for two important improvements over more traditional inference approaches: 1. Deeper Bayesian hierarchies, with noninformative priors replaced by sequences of priors and hyperpriors, that not only remove limitations that seriously degrade the inference on large networks, but also reveal structures at multiple scales; 2. A very efficient inference algorithm that scales well not only for networks with a large number of nodes and edges, but also with an unlimited number of modules. We show also how this approach can be used to sample modular hierarchies from the posterior distribution, as well as to perform model selection. We discuss and analyze the differences between sampling from the posterior and simply finding the single parameter estimate that maximizes it. Furthermore, we expose a direct equivalence between our microcanonical approach and alternative derivations based on the canonical SBM.},

However, this sparsity tends not to be homogeneous, and networks can also be locally dense, for example with a few nodes connecting to a large fraction of the rest of the network, or with small groups of nodes with a large probability of connections between them. Here we show how latent Poisson models which generate hidden multigraphs can be effective at capturing this density heterogeneity, while being more tractable mathematically than some of the alternatives that model simple graphs directly. We show how these latent multigraphs can be reconstructed from data on simple graphs, and how this allows us to disentangle disassortative degree-degree correlations from the constraints of imposed degree sequences, and to improve the identification of community structure in empirically relevant scenarios.},

This area deals with the automated division of a network into fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of its large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption, there is a noticeable gap between what is arguably the state-of-the-art and the methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we attempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to whether they have a "descriptive" or an "inferential" goal. While descriptive methods find patterns in networks based on context-dependent notions of community structure, inferential methods articulate generative models, and attempt to fit them to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into the mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from randomness in a manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive methods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and misleading answers, and thus should be in general avoided. We argue that inferential methods are more typically aligned with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust results, and should be in many cases preferred. We attempt to dispel some myths and half-truths often believed when community detection is employed in practice, in an effort to improve both the use of such methods as well as the interpretation of their results.},

Since our model also includes directed degree correction, we can use it to distinguish nonlocal hierarchical structure from local in- and out-degree imbalance---thus, removing a source of conflation present in most ranking methods. We also demonstrate how we can reliably compare with the results obtained with the unordered SBM variant to determine whether a hierarchical ordering is statistically warranted in the first place.

  abstract = {A fundamental problem associated with the task of network reconstruction from dynamical or behavioral data consists in determining the most appropriate model complexity in a manner that prevents overfitting, and produces an inferred network with a statistically justifiable number of edges. The status quo in this context is based on \$L\_\{1\}\$ regularization combined with cross-validation. However, besides its high computational cost, this commonplace approach unnecessarily ties the promotion of sparsity with weight "shrinkage". This combination forces a trade-off between the bias introduced by shrinkage and the network sparsity, which often results in substantial overfitting even after cross-validation. In this work, we propose an alternative nonparametric regularization scheme based on hierarchical Bayesian inference and weight quantization, which does not rely on weight shrinkage to promote sparsity. Our approach follows the minimum description length (MDL) principle, and uncovers the weight distribution that allows for the most compression of the data, thus avoiding overfitting without requiring cross-validation. The latter property renders our approach substantially faster to employ, as it requires a single fit to the complete data. As a result, we have a principled and efficient inference scheme that can be used with a large variety of generative models, without requiring the number of edges to be known in advance. We also demonstrate that our scheme yields systematically increased accuracy in the reconstruction of both artificial and empirical networks. We highlight the use of our method with the reconstruction of interaction networks between microbial communities from large-scale abundance samples involving in the order of \$10{\textasciicircum}\{4\}\$ to \$10{\textasciicircum}\{5\}\$ species, and demonstrate how the inferred model can be used to predict the outcome of interventions in the system.},

This article introduces two mixture representations for the GIG: one that expresses the distribution as a continuous mixture of inverse Gaussians and another that reveals a recursive relationship between GIGs with different values of \$p\$. The former representation forms the basis for a data augmentation scheme that leads to a geometrically ergodic Gibbs sampler for the GIG. This simple Gibbs sampler, which alternates between gamma and inverse Gaussian conditional distributions, can be incorporated within an encompassing MCMC algorithm when simulation from a GIG is required. The latter representation leads to algorithms for exact, rejection-free sampling as well as CDF evaluation for the GIG with half-integer \$p.\$ We highlight computational examples from the literature where these new algorithms could be applied.},

However few methods cope with estimation of high-frequency spectral tilt to describe the return-phase of the vocal fold vibration, which is crucial to the perception of vocal effort. This paper proposes an improved version of the well-known Iterative Adaptive Inverse Filtering (IAIF) called GFM-IAIF. GFM-IAIF includes a full spectral model of the glottis that incorporates both glottal formant and spectral tilt features. Comparisons with the standard IAIF method show that while GFM-IAIF maintains good performance on vocal tract removal, it significantly improves the perceptive timbral variations associated to vocal effort.},

To further simplify computation, a causal linear model (LFLM) describes the glottal flow with a fully causal set of filters. After expressing these three models under a single analytic formulation, we assessed here their perceptual consistency, when driven by a single parameter Rd related to voice quality. All possible paired combinations of signals generated using six\,Rd levels for each model were presented to subjects who were asked whether the two signals in each pair differed. Model pairs LFLM--LFCALM were judged similar when sharing the same Rd value, and LF was considered the same as LFLM and LFCALM given a consistent shift in Rd. Overall, the similarity between these models encourages the use of the simpler and more computationally efficient models LFCALM and LFLM in speech synthesis applications.},

While existing methods typically require \$O(N{\textasciicircum}3)\$ computation, we introduce a highly-efficient quadratic-time algorithm for computing \${\textbackslash}mathbf K{\textasciicircum}\{1/2\} {\textbackslash}mathbf b\$, \${\textbackslash}mathbf K{\textasciicircum}\{-1/2\} {\textbackslash}mathbf b\$, and their derivatives through matrix-vector multiplication (MVMs). Our method combines Krylov subspace methods with a rational approximation and typically achieves \$4\$ decimal places of accuracy with fewer than \$100\$ MVMs. Moreover, the backward pass requires little additional computation. We demonstrate our method's applicability on matrices as large as \$50,{\textbackslash}!000 {\textbackslash}times 50,{\textbackslash}!000\$ - well beyond traditional methods - with little approximation error. Applying this increased scalability to variational Gaussian processes, Bayesian optimization, and Gibbs sampling results in more powerful models with higher accuracy.},

The estimate of the glottal flow derivative is decomposed into coarse structure, representing the general flow shape, and fine structure, comprising aspiration and other perturbations in the flow, from which model parameters are obtained. The glottal flow derivative is estimated using an inverse filter determined within a time interval of vocal-fold closure that is identified through differences in formant frequency modulation during the open and closed phases of the glottal cycle. This formant motion is predicted by Ananthapadmanabha and Fant (1982) to be a result of time-varying and nonlinear source/vocal tract coupling within a glottal cycle. The glottal flow derivative estimate is modeled using the Liljencrants-Fant (1986) model to capture its coarse structure, while the fine structure of the flow derivative is represented through energy and perturbation measures. The model parameters are used in a Gaussian mixture model speaker identification (SID) system. Both coarse- and fine-structure glottal features are shown to contain significant speaker-dependent information. For a large TIMIT database subset, averaging over male and female SID scores, the coarse-structure parameters achieve about 60\% accuracy, the fine-structure parameters give about 40\% accuracy, and their combination yields about 70\% correct identification. Finally, in preliminary experiments on the counterpart telephone-degraded NTIMIT database, about a 5\% error reduction in SID scores is obtained when source features are combined with traditional mel-cepstral measures.},

Unfortunately, online joint adaptation of both states and parameters in these models remains a challenge. In this paper, we represent the TVAR model by a factor graph and solve the inference problem by automated message passing-based inference for states and parameters. We derive structured variational update rules for a composite ``AR node'' with probabilistic observations that can be used as a plug-in module in hierarchical models, for example, to model the time-varying behavior of the hyper-parameters of a time-varying AR model. Our method includes tracking of variational free energy (FE) as a Bayesian measure of TVAR model performance. The proposed methods are verified on a synthetic data set and validated on real-world data from temperature modeling and speech enhancement tasks.},

  abstract = {Speech perception consists of a set of computations that take continuously varying acoustic waveforms as input and generate discrete representations that make contact with the lexical representations stored in long-term memory as output. Because the perceptual objects that are recognized by the speech perception enter into subsequent linguistic computation, the format that is used for lexical representation and processing fundamentally constrains the speech perceptual processes. Consequently, theories of speech perception must, at some level, be tightly linked to theories of lexical representation. Minimally, speech perception must yield representations that smoothly and rapidly interface with stored lexical items. Adopting the perspective of Marr, we argue and provide neurobiological and psychophysical evidence for the following research programme. First, at the implementational level, speech perception is a multi-time resolution process, with perceptual analyses occurring concurrently on at least two time scales (approx. 20--80{$\mkern1mu$}ms, approx. 150--300{$\mkern1mu$}ms), commensurate with (sub)segmental and syllabic analyses, respectively. Second, at the algorithmic level, we suggest that perception proceeds on the basis of internal forward models, or uses an `analysis-by-synthesis' approach. Third, at the computational level (in the sense of Marr), the theory of lexical representation that we adopt is principally informed by phonological research and assumes that words are represented in the mental lexicon in terms of sequences of discrete segments composed of distinctive features. One important goal of the research programme is to develop linking hypotheses between putative neurobiological primitives (e.g. temporal primitives) and those primitives derived from linguistic inquiry, to arrive ultimately at a biologically sensible and theoretically satisfying model of representation and computation in speech.},

  abstract = {The inability to see and quantify systemic financial risk comes at an immense social cost. Systemic risk in the financial system arises to a large extent as a consequence of the interconnectedness of its institutions, which are linked through networks of different types of financial contracts, such as credit, derivatives, foreign exchange, and securities. The interplay of the various exposure networks can be represented as layers in a financial multi-layer network. In this work we quantify the daily contributions to systemic risk from four layers of the Mexican banking system from 2007 to 2013. We show that focusing on a single layer underestimates the total systemic risk by up to 90\%. By assigning systemic risk levels to individual banks we study the systemic risk profile of the Mexican banking system on all market layers. This profile can be used to quantify systemic risk on a national level in terms of nation-wide expected systemic losses. We show that market-based systemic risk indicators systematically underestimate expected systemic losses. We find that expected systemic losses are up to a factor of four higher now than before the financial crisis of 2007-2008. We find that systemic risk contributions of individual transactions can be up to a factor of one thousand higher than the corresponding credit risk, which creates huge risks for the public. We find an intriguing non-linear effect whereby the sum of systemic risk of all layers underestimates the total risk. The method presented here is the first objective data-driven quantification of systemic risk on national scales that reveal its true levels.},

  abstract = {Detailed data on voicing source characteristics are of interest in both analysis and synthesis of speech. In this study, a time-domain based method of inverse filtering was used to analyze male and female utterances produced with several voice qualities. Fourteen mono-syllabic utterances (ten in normal voicing style, and 2 each in creaky and breathy voice) by each of 8 speakers (4 men, 4 women) were filtered by a set of zero pairs corresponding to the measured formants. The resulting differentiated flow waveforms were analyzed in the time domain and in the frequency domain at voicing onset, near the middle of the vowel, and near the end of voicing. Though there was variability among subjects of the same sex, the women tended to have shorter closed quotients and longer return quotients (the period between maximal rate of change of flow and minimal flow). In the spectral domain, there tended to be less energy at higher frequencies in the middle of the vowel for the women compared to the men. The magnitudes of the male-female differences are similar to those observed for the creaky-normal voicing differences and breathy-normal differences. These differences may arise from a combination of biological, sociological and acoustical effects. Zusammenfassung Ausf{\"u}hrliche Daten {\"u}ber die Kennzeichen der Stimmquelle sind von Interesse sowohl f{\"u}r die Sprachanalyse als f{\"u}r die Sprachsynthese. In dieser Studie wurde eine zeitliche Inversfiltermethode ben{\"u}tzt, um m{\"a}nnliche und weibliche S{\"a}tze mit verschiedenen Stimmqualit{\"a}ten zu analysieren. Vierzehn einsilbige Ausdr{\"u}cke (darin 10 mit normaler Stimme, 2 mit gebrochener, und 2 mit fl{\"u}sternder Stimme) von 8 Sprechern (4 M{\"a}nner und 4 Frauen) wurden durch eine Serie von Zero-paaren gefiltriert, die den gemessen Formanten korrespondierten. Die verschiedenen, differentialen Flutwellenformen die daraus entstanden wurden, im Zeit und Frequenzgebiet, am Stimmen Anfang, in der N{\"a}he der Vokalemitte und am Stimme-ende analysieren. Obwohl Schwankungen zwischen Sprecher vom gleichen Geschlecht festgestellt wurden, waren die weiblichen Stimmen auf k{\"u}rzere geschlossene Quotienten und l{\"a}ngere Perioden zwischen maximaler Erregung und minimalen Flu{$\beta$} gerichtet. Im spektralen Gebiet wurde bei den weiblichen Stimmen weniger Energie in den h{\"o}heren Frequenzen an der Vokalemitte gegen{\"u}ber den m{\"a}nnlichen Stimmen festgestellt. Die Amplituden der Unterschieden zwischen der m{\"a}nnlichen und weiblichen Stimmen sind gleich diesen die in der gebrochenen und fl{\"u}sternden Stimme beobachtet wurden. Die Schwankungen k{\"o}nnen eine Kombination von biologischen, soziologischen und akustischen Gr{\"u}nden haben.

Concomitant advances in integrated circuit technology and computer architecture have aligned to create a technological environ- ment with virtually limitless opportunities for innovation in speech communication applications. In this text, we highlight the central role of DSP techniques in modern speech communication research and appli- cations. We present a comprehensive overview of digital speech process- ing that ranges from the basic nature of the speech signal, through a variety of methods of representing speech in digital form, to applica- tions in voice communication and automatic synthesis and recognition of speech. The breadth of this subject does not allow us to discuss anyaspect of speech processing to great depth; hence our goal is to pro- vide a useful introduction to the wide range of important concepts that comprise the ?eld of digital speech processing.

The resulting Gaussian model has a covariance term that is the sum of Kronecker products, for which efficient parameter inference and out of sample prediction are feasible. On both synthetic examples and applications to phenotype prediction in genetics, we find substantial benefits of modeling structured noise compared to established alternatives.},

Although researchers have measured many speech signal properties, they have failed to identify reliable acoustic characteristics for language classes. This paper presents instrumental measurements based on a consonant/vowel segmentation for eight languages. The measurements suggest that intuitive rhythm types reflect specific phonological properties, which in turn are signaled by the acoustic/phonetic properties of speech. The data support the notion of rhythm classes and also allow the simulation of infant language discrimination, consistent with the hypothesis that newborns rely on a coarse segmentation of speech. A hypothesis is proposed regarding the role of rhythm perception in language acquisition. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.},

  abstract = {Prosody modification involves changing the pitch and duration of speech without affecting the message and naturalness. This paper proposes a method for prosody (pitch and duration) modification using the instants of significant excitation of the vocal tract system during the production of speech. The instants of significant excitation correspond to the instants of glottal closure (epochs) in the case of voiced speech, and to some random excitations like onset of burst in the case of nonvoiced speech. Instants of significant excitation are computed from the linear prediction (LP) residual of speech signals by using the property of average group-delay of minimum phase signals. The modification of pitch and duration is achieved by manipulating the LP residual with the help of the knowledge of the instants of significant excitation. The modified residual is used to excite the time-varying filter, whose parameters are derived from the original speech signal. Perceptual quality of the synthesized speech is good and is without any significant distortion. The proposed method is evaluated using waveforms, spectrograms, and listening tests. The performance of the method is compared with linear prediction pitch synchronous overlap and add (LP-PSOLA) method, which is another method for prosody manipulation based on the modification of the LP residual. The original and the synthesized speech signals obtained by the proposed method and by the LP-PSOLA method are available for listening at http://speech.cs.iitm.ernet.in/Main/result/prosody.html.},

Our model incorporates two key architectural contributions: (1) a timestamp-aware frame encoder that binds visual content with the timestamp of each frame, and (2) a sliding video Q-Former that produces a video token sequence of varying lengths to accommodate videos of various durations. Additionally, we construct an instruction-tuning dataset, encompassing 6 tasks and a total of 125K instances, to further enhance TimeChat's instruction-following performance. Experiment results across various video understanding tasks, such as dense captioning, temporal grounding, and highlight detection, demonstrate TimeChat's strong zero-shot temporal localization and reasoning capabilities. For example, it achieves +9.2 F1 score and +2.8 CIDEr on YouCook2, +5.8 HIT@1 on QVHighlights, and +27.5 R@1 (IoU=0.5) on Charades-STA, compared to state-of-the-art video large language models, holding the potential to serve as a versatile video assistant for long-form video comprehension tasks and satisfy realistic user requirements.},

Yet the precise role of such communities and such interaction in the emergence of core properties of language has largely gone uninvestigated in naturally emerging systems, leaving the few existing computational investigations of this issue at an artificial setting. Here, we take a step toward investigating the precise role of community structure in the emergence of linguistic conventions with both naturalistic empirical data and computational modeling. We first show conventionalization of lexicons in two different classes of naturally emerging signed systems: (a) protolinguistic ``homesigns'' invented by linguistically isolated Deaf individuals, and (b) a natural sign language emerging in a recently formed rich Deaf community. We find that the latter conventionalized faster than the former. Second, we model conventionalization as a population of interacting individuals who adjust their probability of sign use in response to other individuals' actual sign use, following an independently motivated model of language learning (Yang, 2002, 2004). Simulations suggest that a richer social network, like that of natural (signed) languages, conventionalizes faster than a sparser social network, like that of homesign systems. We discuss our behavioral and computational results in light of other work on language emergence, and other work of behavior on complex networks.},

This distribution is intended for structured Bayesian networks, where the structure is given by an ordered block model. That is, the nodes of the graph are objects which fall into categories (or blocks); the blocks have a natural ordering. The presence of a relationship between two objects is denoted by an arrow, from the object of lower category to the object of higher category. The models considered here were introduced in Kemp et al. (2004) for relational data and extended to multivariate data in Mansinghka et al. (2006). The prior over graph structures presented here has an explicit formula. The number of nodes in each layer of the graph follow a Hoppe Ewens urn model. We consider the situation where the nodes of the graph represent random variables, whose joint probability distribution factorises along the DAG. We describe Monte Carlo schemes for finding the optimal aposteriori structure given a data matrix and compare the performance with Mansinghka et al. (2006) and also with the uniform prior.},

However they entail a complexity that is computationally intractable when the number of observations is large, especially when estimated with fully Bayesian methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo. In this paper, we focus on a novel approach for low-rank approximate Bayesian Gaussian processes, based on a basis function approximation via Laplace eigenfunctions for stationary covariance functions. The main contribution of this paper is a detailed analysis of the performance and practical implementation of the method in relation to key factors such as the number of basis functions, domain of the prediction space, and smoothness of the latent function. We provide intuitive visualizations and recommendations for choosing the values of these factors, which make it easier for users to improve approximation accuracy and computational performance. We also propose diagnostics for checking that the number of basis functions and the domain of the prediction space are adequate given the data. The proposed approach is simple and exhibits an attractive computational complexity due to its linear structure, and it is easy to implement in probabilistic programming frameworks. Several illustrative examples of the performance and applicability of the method in the probabilistic programming language Stan are presented together with the underlying Stan model code.},

  abstract = {In this paper we use Gaussian Process (GP) regression to propose a novel approach for predicting volatility of financial returns by forecasting the envelopes of the time series. We provide a direct comparison of their performance to traditional approaches such as GARCH. We compare the forecasting power of three approaches: GP regression on the absolute and squared returns; regression on the envelope of the returns and the absolute returns; and regression on the envelope of the negative and positive returns separately. We use a maximum a posteriori estimate with a Gaussian prior to determine our hyperparameters. We also test the effect of hyperparameter updating at each forecasting step. We use our approaches to forecast out-of-sample volatility of four currency pairs over a 2 year period, at half-hourly intervals. From three kernels, we select the kernel giving the best performance for our data. We use two published accuracy measures and four statistical loss functions to evaluate the forecasting ability of GARCH vs GPs. In mean squared error the GP's perform 20\% better than a random walk model, and 50\% better than GARCH for the same data.},

The noise is modeled as a mixture of Gaussians rather than the usual single Gaussian. This allows different data points to be associated with different noise levels and effectively provides robust estimation of AR coefficients. The VB framework is used to prevent overfitting and provides model-order selection criteria both for AR order and noise model order. We show that for the special case of Gaussian noise and uninformative priors on the noise and weight precisions, the VB framework reduces to the Bayesian evidence framework. The algorithm is applied to synthetic and real data with encouraging results.},

  abstract = {The ongoing unprecedented exponential explosion of available computing power, has radically transformed the methods of statistical inference. What used to be a small minority of statisticians advocating for the use of priors and a strict adherence to bayes theorem, it is now becoming the norm across disciplines. The evolutionary direction is now clear. The trend is towards more realistic, flexible and complex likelihoods characterized by an ever increasing number of parameters. This makes the old question of: What should the prior be? to acquire a new central importance in the modern bayesian theory of inference. Entropic priors provide one answer to the problem of prior selection. The general definition of an entropic prior has existed since 1988, but it was not until 1998 that it was found that they provide a new notion of complete ignorance. This paper re-introduces the family of entropic priors as minimizers of mutual information between the data and the parameters, as in [rodriguez98b], but with a small change and a correction. The general formalism is then applied to two large classes of models: Discrete probabilistic networks and univariate finite mixtures of gaussians. It is also shown how to perform inference by efficiently sampling the corresponding posterior distributions.},

Numerous types of meso-scale structures can occur in networks, but investigations of such features have focused predominantly on the identification and study of community structure. In this paper, we develop a new method to investigate the meso-scale feature known as core-periphery structure, which entails identifying densely-connected core nodes and sparsely-connected periphery nodes. In contrast to communities, the nodes in a core are also reasonably well-connected to those in the periphery. Our new method of computing core-periphery structure can identify multiple cores in a network and takes different possible cores into account. We illustrate the differences between our method and several existing methods for identifying which nodes belong to a core, and we use our technique to examine core-periphery structure in examples of friendship, collaboration, transportation, and voting networks.},

When the input function to the operator is unobserved and has a GP prior, the NVKM constitutes a powerful method for both single and multiple output regression, and can be viewed as a nonlinear and nonparametric latent force model. When the input function is observed, the NVKM can be used to perform Bayesian system identification. We use recent advances in efficient sampling of explicit functions from GPs to map process realisations through the Volterra series without resorting to numerical integration, allowing scalability through doubly stochastic variational inference, and avoiding the need for Gaussian approximations of the output processes. We demonstrate the performance of the model for both multiple output regression and system identification using standard benchmarks.},

Among the possible characterizations, the core-periphery paradigm models the network as the union of a dense core with a sparsely connected periphery, highlighting the role of each node on the basis of its topological position. Here we show that the core-periphery structure can effectively be profiled by elaborating the behaviour of a random walker. A curve---the core-periphery profile---and a numerical indicator are derived, providing a global topological portrait. Simultaneously, a coreness value is attributed to each node, qualifying its position and role. The application to social, technological, economical, and biological networks reveals the power of this technique in disclosing the overall network structure and the peculiar role of some specific nodes.},

Moreover, a single common register can be used for different global variables in distinct regions of a program call graph. This is realized by identifying subgraphs, of the program call graph, called webs, where the variable is used. The second optimization technique, called spill code motion, involves the identification of regions of the call graph, called clusters, that facilitate the movement of spill instructions to procedures which are executed relatively less often. This decreases the overhead of register saves and restores which must be executed for procedure calls.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inference methods rely on numerical algorithms for both model selection and parameter inference. In general, these algorithms require a high computational effort to yield reliable estimates. One of the major challenges in phylogenetics is the estimation of the marginal likelihood. This quantity is commonly used for comparing different evolutionary models, but its calculation, even for simple models, incurs high computational cost. Another interesting challenge relates to the estimation of the posterior distribution. Often, long Markov chains are required to get sufficient samples to carry out parameter inference, especially for tree distributions. In general, these problems are addressed separately by using different procedures. Nested sampling (NS) is a Bayesian computation algorithm, which provides the means to estimate marginal likelihoods together with their uncertainties, and to sample from the posterior distribution at no extra cost. The methods currently used in phylogenetics for marginal likelihood estimation lack in practicality due to their dependence on many tuning parameters and their inability of most implementations to provide a direct way to calculate the uncertainties associated with the estimates, unlike NS. In this article, we introduce NS to phylogenetics. Its performance is analysed under different scenarios and compared to established methods. We conclude that NS is a competitive and attractive algorithm for phylogenetic inference. An implementation is available as a package for BEAST 2 under the LGPL licence, accessible at https://github.com/BEAST2-Dev/nested-sampling.},

Our extension has two primary advantages. Firstly, unlike existing spectral approaches that yield infinite differentiability, the kernels we introduce allow learning the degree of differentiability of the latent function in Gaussian process (GP) models and functions in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) in other kernel methods. Secondly, we show that some of the kernels we propose require fewer parameters than existing spectral kernels for the same accuracy, thereby leading to faster and more robust inference. Finally, we generalize our approach and propose a flexible and tractable family of spectral kernels that we prove can approximate any continuous bounded nonstationary kernel.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are used in machine learning to learn input-output mappings from observed data. Gaussian process regression is based on imposing a Gaussian process prior on the unknown regressor function and statistically conditioning it on the observed data. In system identification, Gaussian processes are used to form time series prediction models such as non-linear finite-impulse response (NFIR) models as well as non-linear autoregressive (NARX) models. Gaussian process state-space models (GPSS) can be used to learn the dynamic and measurement models for a state-space representation of the input-output data. Temporal and spatio-temporal Gaussian processes can be directly used to form regressor on the data in the time domain. The aim of this article is to briefly outline the main directions in system identification methods using Gaussian processes.},

In this paper, it is shown that this framework may be effectively used for ECG beat segmentation and extraction of fiducial points. Analytic expressions for the determination of points and intervals are derived and evaluated on various real ECG signals. Simulation results show that the method can contribute to and enhance the clinical ECG beat segmentation performance.},

We introduce Toolformer, a model trained to decide which APIs to call, when to call them, what arguments to pass, and how to best incorporate the results into future token prediction. This is done in a self-supervised way, requiring nothing more than a handful of demonstrations for each API. We incorporate a range of tools, including a calculator, a Q{\textbackslash}\&A system, two different search engines, a translation system, and a calendar. Toolformer achieves substantially improved zero-shot performance across a variety of downstream tasks, often competitive with much larger models, without sacrificing its core language modeling abilities.},

However, it is well known that this formula can lead to serious instabilities in the presence of roundoff error. If the system matrix is symmetric positive definite, it is almost always possible to use a representation based on the Cholesky decomposition which renders the same results (in exact arithmetic) at the same or less operational cost, but typically is much more numerically stable. In this note, we show how the Cholesky decomposition can be updated to incorporate low rank additions or downdated for low rank subtractions. We also discuss a special case of an indefinite update of rank two. The methods discussed here are well-known in the numerical mathematics literature, and code for most of them can be found in the LINPACK suite},

Approaches to reducing the errors were assessed in two experiments. In the first, synthetic vowels were constructed with five different first formant (F1) values and nine different F0 values; formant bandwidths, and higher formant frequencies, were constant. Input formant values were compared to manual measurements and automatic measures using the linear prediction coding-Burg algorithm, linear prediction closed-phase covariance, the weighted linear prediction-attenuated main excitation (WLP-AME) algorithm [Alku, Pohjalainen, Vainio, Laukkanen, and Story (2013). J. Acoust. Soc. Am. 134(2), 1295--1313], spectra smoothed cepstrally and by averaging repeated discrete Fourier transforms. Formants were also measured manually from pruned reassigned spectrograms (RSs) [Fulop (2011). Speech Spectrum Analysis (Springer, Berlin)]. All but WLP-AME and RS had large errors in the direction of the strongest harmonic; the smallest errors occur with WLP-AME and RS. In the second experiment, these methods were used on vowels in isolated words spoken by four speakers. Results for the natural speech show that F0 bias affects all automatic methods, including WLP-AME; only the formants measured manually from RS appeared to be accurate. In addition, RS coped better with weaker formants and glottal fry.},

Acoust. Soc. Am. 139(2), 713--727]. To date, validating its accuracy has depended on formant synthesis for ground truth values of these resonances. Synthesis is easily controlled, but it has many intrinsic assumptions that do not necessarily accurately realize the acoustics in the way that physical resonances would. Here, we show that physical models of the vocal tract with derivable resonance values allow a separate approach to the ground truth, with a different range of limitations. Our three-dimensional printed vocal tract models were excited by white noise, allowing an accurate determination of the resonance frequencies. Then, sources with a range of fundamental frequencies were implemented, allowing a direct assessment of whether RS avoided the systematic bias towards the nearest strong harmonic to which other analysis techniques are prone. RS was indeed accurate at fundamental frequencies up to 300\,Hz; above that, accuracy was somewhat reduced. Future directions include testing mechanical models with the dimensions of children's vocal tracts and making RS more broadly useful by automating the detection of resonances.},

  abstract = {The paper presents a particle-filtering method for estimating formant frequencies of speech signals from spectrograms. First, frequency bands corresponding to the analyzed formants are extracted via a two-step dynamic programming based algorithm. A particle-filtering method is then used to locate accurately formants in every formant area based on the posterior PDF described by a set of support points with associated weights. Formant trajectories of voiced frames of a group of 81 utterances were manually tracked and labeled, partly for model training and partly for algorithm evaluation. In the experiments, the proposed method obtains average estimation errors of 72, 115, and 113 Hz for the first three formants, respectively, whereas the LPC based method induces 118, 172, and 250 Hz deviations. The experimental results show that the formants estimated by the proposed method are quite reliable and the trajectories are more accurate than LPC.},

We present a speech analysis method based on pole-zero modeling of speech with mixed block sparse and Gaussian excitation. By using a pole-zero model, instead of the all-pole model, a better spectral fitting can be expected. Moreover, motivated by the block sparse glottal flow excitation during voiced speech and the white noise excitation for unvoiced speech, we model the excitation sequence as a combination of block sparse signals and white noise. A variational EM (VEM) method is proposed for estimating the posterior PDFs of the block sparse residuals and point estimates of modelling parameters within a sparse Bayesian learning framework. Compared to conventional pole-zero and all-pole based methods, experimental results show that the proposed method has lower spectral distortion and good performance in reconstructing of the block sparse excitation.},

Previous justifications use intuitive arguments and rely on the properties of entropy and cross-entropy as information measures. The approach here assumes that reasonable methods of inductive inference should lead to consistent results when there are different ways of taking the same information into account (for example, in different coordinate system). This requirement is formalized as four consistency axioms. These are stated in terms of an abstract information operator and make no reference to information measures. It is proved that the principle of maximum entropy is correct in the following sense: maximizing any function but entropy will lead to inconsistency unless that function and entropy have identical maxima. In other words given information in the form of constraints on expected values, there is only one (distribution satisfying the constraints that can be chosen by a procedure that satisfies the consistency axioms; this unique distribution can be obtained by maximizing entropy. This result is established both directly and as a special case (uniform priors) of an analogous result for the principle of minimum cross-entropy. Results are obtained both for continuous probability densities and for discrete distributions.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses a problem that is of paramount importance in solving crimes wherein voice may be key evidence, or the only evidence: that of describing the perpetrator. The term Forensic anthropometry from voice refers to the deduction of the speaker's physical dimensions from voice. There are multiple studies in the literature that approach this problem in different ways, many of which depend on the availability of sufficient volumes of speech for analysis. However, in the case of many voice-based crimes, the voice evidence available may be limited. In such cases it is especially advantageous to regard the recorded signal as comprising multiple pieces of evidence. In this paper, we show how this can be done. We explain why, for any anthropometric measurement from speech, it makes sense to consider the contributions of each articulatory-phonetic unit independently of others, and to aggregate the deductions from them only in the aftermath. This approach is based on the hypothesis that the relative evidence given by different compositional units of speech can be more indicative of the anthropometric factor being deduced, than the evidence derived from the aggregate voice signal. We explain the applicability of this approach through experiments on standard speech databases.},

The prior cannot usefully be identified with a state of knowledge, and indeed it is not so identified in common scientific practice. Rather, it can be identified with the question one asks. Accordingly, priors are free constructions. Their informal ill-defined and subjective characteristics must carry over into the conclusions one chooses to draw from experiments or observations.},

Then the only permitted use of A is to apply it to one or a few vectors vo, VI, V2, .... We use the resulting vectors in an entropic Bayesian algorithm to estimate the eigenvalue spectrum of A, and thence its integral properties.},

It is the prime result of the computation, and is accompanied by an estimate of numerical uncertainty. Samples from the posterior distribution are an optional by-product, obtainable for any temperature. The method relies on sampling within a hard constraint on likelihood value, as opposed to the softened likelihood of annealing methods. Progress depends only on the shape of the "nested" contours of likelihood, and not on the likelihood values. This invariance (over monotonic re-labelling) allows the method to deal with a class of phase-change problems which effectively defeat thermal annealing.},

In a world lacking probes of unlimited delicacy, our knowledge of quantities is necessarily accompanied by uncertainty. Consequently, physics requires a calculus of number pairs and not only scalars for quantity alone. Basic symmetries of shuffling and sequencing dictate that pairs obey ordinary component-wise addition, but they can have three different multiplication rules. We call those rules A, B and C. ``A'' shows that pairs behave as complex numbers, which is why quantum theory is complex. However, consistency with the ordinary scalar rules of probability shows that the fundamental object is not a particle on its Hilbert sphere but a stream represented by a Gaussian distribution. ``B'' is then applied to pairs of complex numbers (qubits) and produces the Pauli matrices for which its operation defines the space of four vectors. ``C'' then allows integration of what can then be recognised as energy-momentum into time and space. The picture is entirely consistent. Spacetime is a construct of quantum and not a container for it.},

It has been suggested that sensory systems might have evolved highly efficient coding strategies to maximize the information conveyed to the brain while minimizing the required energy and neural resources. Here we show that, for natural sounds, the complete acoustic waveform can be represented efficiently with a nonlinear model based on a population spike code. In this model, idealized spikes encode the precise temporal positions and magnitudes of underlying acoustic features. We find that when the features are optimized for coding either natural sounds or speech, they show striking similarities to time-domain cochlear filter estimates, have a frequency-bandwidth dependence similar to that of auditory nerve fibres, and yield significantly greater coding efficiency than conventional signal representations. These results indicate that the auditory code might approach an information theoretic optimum and that the acoustic structure of speech might be adapted to the coding capacity of the mammalian auditory system.},

We derive an interesting decoupling of the problem that allow us to unravel the role played by the interconnections of the multiplex in the dynamical processes on top of them. Capitalizing on this decoupling we perform an asymptotic analysis that allow us to derive analytical expressions for the full spectrum of eigenvalues. This spectrum is used to gain insight into physical phenomena on top of multiplex, specifically, diffusion processes and synchronizability.},

This reduces the problematic cubic complexity of Gaussian process regression in the number of time steps into linear time complexity. The representation is based on expanding periodic covariance functions into a series of stochastic resonators. The explicit representation of the canonical periodic covariance function is written out and the expansion is shown to uniformly converge to the exact covariance function with a known convergence rate. The framework is generalized to quasi-periodic covariance functions by introducing damping terms in the system and applied to two sets of real data. The approach could be easily extended to non-stationary and spatio-temporal variants.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes provide a flexible framework for forecasting, removing noise, and interpreting long temporal datasets. State space modelling (Kalman filtering) enables these non-parametric models to be deployed on long datasets by reducing the complexity to linear in the number of data points. The complexity is still cubic in the state dimension m which is an impediment to practical application. In certain special cases (Gaussian likelihood, regular spacing) the GP posterior will reach a steady posterior state when the data are very long. We leverage this and formulate an inference scheme for GPs with general likelihoods, where inference is based on single-sweep EP (assumed density filtering). The infinite-horizon model tackles the cubic cost in the state dimensionality and reduces the cost in the state dimension m to O(m{\textasciicircum}2) per data point. The model is extended to online-learning of hyperparameters. We show examples for large finite-length modelling problems, and present how the method runs in real-time on a smartphone on a continuous data stream updated at 100 Hz.},

The method is based on an approximate series expansion of the covariance function in terms of an eigenfunction expansion of the Laplace operator in a compact subset of \$\${\textbackslash}mathbb \{R\}{\textasciicircum}d\$\$. On this approximate eigenbasis, the eigenvalues of the covariance function can be expressed as simple functions of the spectral density of the Gaussian process, which allows the GP inference to be solved under a computational cost scaling as \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(nm{\textasciicircum}2)\$\$ (initial) and \$\${\textbackslash}mathcal \{O\}(m{\textasciicircum}3)\$\$ (hyperparameter learning) with m basis functions and n data points. Furthermore, the basis functions are independent of the parameters of the covariance function, which allows for very fast hyperparameter learning. The approach also allows for rigorous error analysis with Hilbert space theory, and we show that the approximation becomes exact when the size of the compact subset and the number of eigenfunctions go to infinity. We also show that the convergence rate of the truncation error is independent of the input dimensionality provided that the differentiability order of the covariance function increases appropriately, and for the squared exponential covariance function it is always bounded by \$\$\{{\textbackslash}sim \}1/m\$\$ regardless of the input dimensionality. The expansion generalizes to Hilbert spaces with an inner product which is defined as an integral over a specified input density. The method is compared to previously proposed methods theoretically and through empirical tests with simulated and real data.},

A Bayesian approach requires the user to define a prior distribution for the coefficients of the AR(p) model. Although it is easy to write down some prior, it is not at all obvious how to understand and interpret the prior distribution, to ensure that it behaves according to the users prior knowledge. In this paper, we approach this problem using the recently developed ideas of penalised complexity (PC) priors. These prior have important properties like robustness and invariance to reparameterisations, as well as a clear interpretation. A PC prior is computed based on specific principles, where model component complexity is penalised in terms of deviation from simple base model formulations. In the AR(1) case, we discuss two natural base model choices, corresponding to either independence in time or no change in time. The latter case is illustrated in a survival model with possible timedependent frailty. For higher-order processes, we propose a sequential approach, where the base model for AR(p) is the corresponding AR(p - 1) model expressed using the partial autocorrelations. The properties of the new prior distribution is compared with the reference prior in a simulation study.},

In such networks, each relational definition gives rise to a layer. While each layer provides its own set of information, community structure across layers can be collectively utilized to discover and quantify underlying relational patterns between nodes. To concisely extract information from a multilayer network, we propose to identify and combine sets of layers with meaningful similarities in community structure. In this paper, we describe the "strata multilayer stochastic block model'' (sMLSBM), a probabilistic model for multilayer community structure. The central extension of the model is that there exist groups of layers, called "strata'', which are defined such that all layers in a given stratum have community structure described by a common stochastic block model (SBM). That is, layers in a stratum exhibit similar node-to-community assignments and SBM probability parameters. Fitting the sMLSBM to a multilayer network provides a joint clustering that yields node-to-community and layer-to-stratum assignments, which cooperatively aid one another during inference. We describe an algorithm for separating layers into their appropriate strata and an inference technique for estimating the SBM parameters for each stratum. We demonstrate our method using synthetic networks and a multilayer network inferred from data collected in the Human Microbiome Project.},

  abstract = {In a Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models, parameter estimation and clustering are sometimes less straightforward than might be expected. In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so-called `label switching' problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

While some improper priors have attractive properties such as, e.g., low frequentist risk, it is generally claimed that Bartlett's paradox implies that using improper priors for the parameters in alternative models results in Bayes factors that are not well defined, thus preventing model comparison in this case. In this paper we demonstrate this latter result is not generally true and expand the class of priors that may be used for computing posterior odds to include some improper priors. Our approach is to give a new representation of the issue of undefined Bayes factors and, from this representation, develop classes of improper priors from which well defined Bayes factors may be derived. This approach involves either augmenting or normalising the prior measure for the parameters. One of these classes of priors includes the well known and commonly employed shrinkage prior. Estimation of Bayes factors is demonstrated for a reduced rank model.},

  abstract = {In this tribute article to D.G. Miller, we review some historical and recent contributions to understanding the myoelastic-aerodynamic (MEAD) theory of phonation and the related acoustic phenomena in subglottal and vocal tract. At the time of the formulation of MEAD by van den Berg in late 1950s, it was assumed that vocal fold oscillations are self-sustained thanks to increased subglottal pressure pushing the glottis to open and decreased subglottal pressure allowing the glottis to close. In vivo measurements of subglottal pressures during phonation invalidated these assumptions, however, and showed that at low fundamental frequencies subglottal pressure rather tends to reach a maximum value at the beginning of glottal closure and then exhibits damped oscillations. These events can be interpreted as transient acoustic resonance phenomena in the subglottal tract that are triggered by glottal closure. They are analogous to the transient acoustic phenomena seen in the vocal tract. Rather than subglottal pressure oscillations, a more efficient mechanism of transfer of aerodynamic energy to the vocal fold vibrations has been identified in the vertical phase differences (mucosal waves) making the glottal shape more convergent during glottis opening than during glottis closing. Along with other discoveries, these findings form the basis of our current understanding of MEAD.},

In this paper we develop a Bayesian approach to mixture modelling based on Student-t distributions, which are heavier tailed than Gaussians and hence more robust. By expressing the Student-t distribution as a marginalization over additional latent variables we are able to derive a tractable variational inference algorithm for this model, which includes Gaussian mixtures as a special case. Results on a variety of real data sets demonstrate the improved robustness of our approach.},

  abstract = {The field of animal vocal communication has benefited greatly from improved understanding of vocal production mechanisms and specifically from the generalization of the source--filter theory of speech production to non-human mammals. The application of the source--filter theory has enabled researchers to decompose the acoustic structure of vocal signals according to their mode of production and thereby to predict the acoustic variation that is caused by anatomical or physiological attributes of the caller. The source--filter theory states that vocal signals result from a two-stage production, with the glottal wave generated in the larynx (the source), being subsequently filtered in the supralaryngeal vocal tract (the filter). This theory predicts that independent indexical information such as body size, weight, age and sex can be contained in both the glottal wave (mostly characterized by its fundamental frequency), and the spectral envelope of the radiated vocalization (mostly characterized by the vocal tract resonances or formant frequencies). Additionally, physiological fluctuations in emotional or motivational state have been found to influence the acoustic characteristics of signals in a reliable and predictable manner that is perceptually available to receivers. While animal vocalizations contain some dynamic attributes, their static attributes are sufficient to provide an effective means of acoustic individual discrimination both within and across call types. In this paper, we draw together a wealth of experimental work conducted within the source--filter framework over the last decade and we review how such experiments have elucidated the communicative value of animal vocalizations.},

However, existing GP approximations do not simultaneously support large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series which is a hallmark of many applications. Pseudo-point approximations, one of the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs to large data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid spatial data. However, they cannot handle long temporal observation horizons effectively reverting to cubic computational scaling in the time dimension. State space GP approximations are well suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear complexity in the number of temporal observations, but have a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle off-the-grid spatial data. In this work we show that there is a simple and elegant way to combine pseudo-point methods with the state space GP approximation framework to get the best of both worlds. The approach hinges on a surprising conditional independence property which applies to space--time separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more scalable and applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal problems than either method on its own.},

  abstract = {In a number of data-driven applications such as detection of arrhythmia, interferometry or audio compression, observations are acquired indistinctly in the time or frequency domains: temporal observations allow us to study the spectral content of signals (e.g., audio), while frequency-domain observations are used to reconstruct temporal/spatial data (e.g., MRI). Classical approaches for spectral analysis rely either on i) a discretisation of the time and frequency domains, where the fast Fourier transform stands out as the de facto off-the-shelf resource, or ii) stringent parametric models with closed-form spectra. However, the general literature fails to cater for missing observations and noise-corrupted data. Our aim is to address the lack of a principled treatment of data acquired indistinctly in the temporal and frequency domains in a way that is robust to missing or noisy observations, and that at the same time models uncertainty effectively. To achieve this aim, we first define a joint probabilistic model for the temporal and spectral representations of signals, to then perform a Bayesian model update in the light of observations, thus jointly reconstructing the complete (latent) time and frequency representations. The proposed model is analysed from a classical spectral analysis perspective, and its implementation is illustrated through intuitive examples. Lastly, we show that the proposed model is able to perform joint time and frequency reconstruction of real-world audio, healthcare and astronomy signals, while successfully dealing with missing data and handling uncertainty (noise) naturally against both classical and modern approaches for spectral estimation.},

We first analyse the direct model to establish the conditions under which the model is well defined. Then, we turn to the inverse problem, where we study i) some necessary conditions under which Bayesian deconvolution is feasible, and ii) to which extent the filter \$h\$ can be learnt from data or approximated for the blind deconvolution case. The proposed approach, termed Gaussian process deconvolution (GPDC) is compared to other deconvolution methods conceptually, via illustrative examples, and using real-world datasets.},

In this paper, we introduce a new framework to learn, infer and predict nonparametric PDFs with a Gaussian process prior. This is a challenging problem since there is no explicit formulas for conditional expectations and covariances. The proposed methods have two main advantages: Analyzing PDFs with an intrinsic manifold structure and establishing the connection with the Hilbert sphere when endowed with an appropriate metric. Therefore, all solutions are valid PDFs with non-negative values and integrate to one. We formulate the problem as constrained spherical Gaussian processes leading to an efficient solution with a spherical Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling. We test and evaluate different strategies with extensive experiments on both simulations and real dataset.},

Starting from basic rules of probability, we present the Bayes' theorem and its applications. In particular we discuss about how to calculate simple and joint probability distributions and the Bayesian evidence, a model dependent quantity that allows to assign probabilities to different hypotheses from the analysis of a same data set. To give some practical examples, these methods are applied to two concrete cases. In the first example, the presence or not of a satellite line in an atomic spectrum is investigated. In the second example, we determine the most probable model among a set of possible profiles from the analysis of a statistically poor spectrum. We show also how to calculate the probability distribution of the main spectral component without having to determine uniquely the spectrum modeling. For these two studies, we implement the program Nested\_fit to calculate the different probability distributions and other related quantities. Nested\_fit is a Fortran90/Python code developed during the last years for analysis of atomic spectra. As indicated by the name, it is based on the nested algorithm, which is presented in details together with the program itself.},

A statistical inference model was developed to characterize the relationship between vowel type and VTL, on the one hand, and formant frequency and vocal cavity size, on the other. The model was applied to two well known developmental studies of formant frequency. The results show that VTL is the major source of variability after vowel type and that the contribution due to other factors like developmental changes in oral-pharyngeal ratio is small relative to the residual measurement noise. The results suggest that speakers adjust the shape of the vocal tract as they grow to maintain a specific pattern of formant frequencies for individual vowels. This formant-pattern hypothesis motivates development of a statistical-inference model for estimating VTL from formant-frequency data. The technique is illustrated using a third developmental study of formant frequencies. The VTLs of the speakers are estimated and used to provide a more accurate description of the complicated relationship between VTL and glottal pulse rate as children mature into adults.},

Natural signals are assumed to be formed by the superposition of distinct time-frequency components, with the analytic goal being to infer these components by application of Bayes' rule. The framework serves to unify various existing models for natural time-series; it relates to both the Wiener and Kalman filters, and with suitable assumptions yields inferential interpretations of the short-time Fourier transform, spectrogram, filter bank, and wavelet representations. Value is gained by placing time-frequency analysis on the same probabilistic basis as is often employed in applications such as denoising, source separation, or recognition. Uncertainty in the time-frequency representation can be propagated correctly to application-specific stages, improving the handing of noise and missing data. Probabilistic learning allows modules to be co-adapted; thus, the time-frequency representation can be adapted to both the demands of the application and the time-varying statistics of the signal at hand. Similarly, the application module can be adapted to fine properties of the signal propagated by the initial time-frequency processing. We demonstrate these benefits by combining probabilistic time-frequency representations with non-negative matrix factorization, finding benefits in audio denoising and inpainting tasks, albeit with higher computational cost than incurred by the standard approach.},

We accommodate time-varying phenomena with diverse properties by means of a flexible mathematical representation of the data. We characterize statistically such time-series by a Bayesian analysis of their densities. The density that describes the transition of the state from time t to the next time instant t+1 is used for implementation of novel sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) methods. We present a set of SMC methods for inference of latent ARMA time-series with innovations correlated in time for different assumptions in knowledge of parameters. The methods operate in a unified and consistent manner for data with diverse memory properties.

The peak locations are estimated either by root-solving or by computing a coarse spectrum and finding its maxima. We discuss four sources of systematic error in this analysis: (1) quantization of the speech signal due to the fundamental frequency, (2) incorrect order for the LP filter, (3) exclusive reliance upon root-solving, and (4) the three-point parabolic interpolation used to compensate for the coarse spectrum. We show that the expected error due to F0 quantization is {$\sim$}10\% of F0, and that the other three sources can independently skew the final formant estimates by 10--80 Hz. We also show that errors due to incorrect filter order are related to systematic differences between speakers and phonetic classes, and that root-solving is especially error-prone for low formants or when formants are close to each other. We discuss methods for avoiding these errors and improving the accuracy of formant estimation, and give a heuristic for estimating the optimal filter order of a steady-state signal.},

Previous attempts to construct acoustic models that remove this assumption have suffered from a significant increase in the number of parameters to train. Another weakness of current acoustic models is that they do not account for the origin of derived features (estimated derivatives). We show how to both remove the independence assumption and properly account for derived features, with little or no increase in the number of parameters to train, by applying the principle of maximum entropy. We also show that ignoring the origins of derived features in training HMM acoustic models can lead to severe distortions of the effective language model. Evaluation of our maxent model on a simple problem cuts an already-low error rate in half compared to an equivalent HMM with the same number of parameters.},

  abstract = {Since the 2007--2009 financial crisis, substantial academic effort has been dedicated to improving our understanding of interbank lending networks (ILNs). Because of data limitations or by choice, the literature largely lacks multiple loan maturities. We employ a complete interbank loan contract dataset to investigate whether maturity details are informative of the network structure. Applying the layered stochastic block model of Peixoto (2015) and other tools from network science on a time series of bilateral loans with multiple maturity layers in the Russian ILN, we find that collapsing all such layers consistently obscures mesoscale structure. The optimal maturity granularity lies between completely collapsing and completely separating the maturity layers and depends on the development phase of the interbank market, with a more developed market requiring more layers for optimal description. Closer inspection of the inferred maturity bins associated with the optimal maturity granularity reveals specific economic functions, from liquidity intermediation to financing. Collapsing a network with multiple underlying maturity layers or extracting one such layer, common in economic research, is therefore not only an incomplete representation of the ILN's mesoscale structure, but also conceals existing economic functions. This holds important insights and opportunities for theoretical and empirical studies on interbank market functioning, contagion, stability, and on the desirable level of regulatory data disclosure.},

They are of primary concern in acoustic phonetics and speech recognition. Despite this, making accurate measurements of the formants, which we dub ``the formant measurement problem'' for convenience, is as yet not considered to be fully resolved. One particular shortcoming is the lack of error bars on the formant frequencies' estimates. As a first step towards remedying this, we propose a new approach for the formant measuring problem in the particular case of steady-state vowels---a case which occurs quite abundantly in natural speech. The approach is to look at the formant measuring problem from the viewpoint of Bayesian spectrum analysis. We develop a pitch-synchronous linear model for steady-state vowels and apply it to the open-mid front unrounded vowel [{$\varepsilon$}] observed in a real speech utterance.},

In this steady-state, the vowel waveform appears as a quasi-periodic string of elementary units called pitch periods. Humans perceive this quasi-periodic regularity as a definite pitch. Likewise, so-called pitch-synchronous methods exploit this regularity by using the duration of the pitch periods as a natural time scale for their analysis. In this work, we present a simple pitch-synchronous method using a Bayesian approach for estimating formants that slightly generalizes the basic approach of modeling the pitch periods as a superposition of decaying sinusoids, one for each vowel formant, by explicitly taking into account the additional low-frequency content in the waveform which arises not from formants but rather from the glottal pulse. We model this low-frequency content in the time domain as a polynomial trend function that is added to the decaying sinusoids. The problem then reduces to a rather familiar one in macroeconomics: estimate the cycles (our decaying sinusoids) independently from the trend (our polynomial trend function); in other words, detrend the waveform of steady-state waveforms. We show how to do this efficiently.},

In this paper, we lower this dominating computational complexity to \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(NM)\$ with no additional approximations. We can do this because we realize that the precision matrix can be split into a sum of Hankel-Toeplitz matrices, each having \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(M)\$ unique entries. Based on this realization we propose computing only these unique entries at \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(NM)\$ costs. Further, we develop two theorems that prescribe sufficient conditions for the complexity reduction to hold generally for a wide range of other approximate GP models, such as the Variational Fourier features approach. The two theorems do this with no assumptions on the data and no additional approximations of the GP models themselves. Thus, our contribution provides a pure speed-up of several existing, widely used, GP approximations, without further approximations},

Five words per vowel, two of which were produced twice, were analyzed for fo and estimates of the first four formants frequencies from 190 (97 female, 93 male) typically developing speakers ages 4--20\,years old. Findings revealed developmental trajectories with decreasing values of fo and formant frequencies. Sex differences in fo emerged at age 7. The decrease of fo was larger in males than females with a marked drop during puberty. Sex differences in formant frequencies appeared at the earliest age under study and varied with vowel and formant. Generally, the higher formants (F3-F4) were sensitive to sex differences. Inter- and intra-speaker variability declined with age but had somewhat different patterns, likely reflective of maturing motor control that interacts with the changing anatomy. This study reports a source of developmental normative data on fo and the first four formants in both sexes. The different developmental patterns in the first four formants and vowel-formant interactions in sex differences likely point to anatomic factors, although speech-learning phenomena cannot be discounted.},

  abstract = {Gaussian Process (GP) models are a powerful and flexible tool for non-parametric regression and classification. Computation for GP models is intensive, since computing the posterior density, \${\textbackslash}pi\$, for covariance function parameters requires computation of the covariance matrix, C, a \$pn{\textasciicircum}2\$ operation, where p is the number of covariates and n is the number of training cases, and then inversion of C, an \$n{\textasciicircum}3\$ operation. We introduce MCMC methods based on the "temporary mapping and caching" framework, using a fast approximation, \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}*\$, as the distribution needed to construct the temporary space. We propose two implementations under this scheme: "mapping to a discretizing chain", and "mapping with tempered transitions", both of which are exactly correct MCMC methods for sampling \${\textbackslash}pi\$, even though their transitions are constructed using an approximation. These methods are equivalent when their tuning parameters are set at the simplest values, but differ in general. We compare how well these methods work when using several approximations, finding on synthetic datasets that a \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}*\$ based on the "Subset of Data" (SOD) method is almost always more efficient than standard MCMC using only \${\textbackslash}pi\$. On some datasets, a more sophisticated \${\textbackslash}pi{\textasciicircum}*\$ based on the "Nystr{\textbackslash}"om-Cholesky" method works better than SOD.},

By associating every generative parameter with a probability distribution, it becomes possible to convert every standard speech analysis task into a probabilistic inference task, thereby grounding every such task with quantifiable measures of bias and consistency. The previously published PAT model did not adequately model AM-FM and therefore phase of the voice source. In this paper, we model the AM-FM of the voice source using an autoregressive process. The resulting model is a non-linear state-space model and thus has no closed-form inference algorithm, but effective inference can be achieved by using Auxiliary Particle Filtering (APF) and Taylor expansion assisted Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Results demonstrate that, unlike previous speech models, this model is able to account for the phase of the voice source, achieving signal reconstruction with 8.79dB SNR.},

However, computational constraints with standard inference procedures have limited exact GPs to problems with fewer than about ten thousand training points, necessitating approximations for larger datasets. In this paper, we develop a scalable approach for exact GPs that leverages multi-GPU parallelization and methods like linear conjugate gradients, accessing the kernel matrix only through matrix multiplication. By partitioning and distributing kernel matrix multiplies, we demonstrate that an exact GP can be trained on over a million points, a task previously thought to be impossible with current computing hardware, in less than 2 hours. Moreover, our approach is generally applicable, without constraints to grid data or specific kernel classes. Enabled by this scalability, we perform the first-ever comparison of exact GPs against scalable GP approximations on datasets with \$10{\textasciicircum}4 {\textbackslash}!-{\textbackslash}! 10{\textasciicircum}6\$ data points, showing dramatic performance improvements.},

Ordinarily, the connection topology is assumed to be either completely regular or completely random. But many biological, technological and social networks lie somewhere between these two extremes. Here we explore simple models of networks that can be tuned through this middle ground: regular networks 'rewired' to introduce increasing amounts of disorder. We find that these systems can be highly clustered, like regular lattices, yet have small characteristic path lengths, like random graphs. We call them 'small-world' networks, by analogy with the small-world phenomenon13,14 (popularly known as six degrees of separation15). The neural network of the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the power grid of the western United States, and the collaboration graph of film actors are shown to be small-world networks. Models of dynamical systems with small-world coupling display enhanced signal-propagation speed, computational power, and synchronizability. In particular, infectious diseases spread more easily in small-world networks than in regular lattices.},

This additional source of uncertainty, due to limited computation, is entirely ignored when using the approximate posterior. Therefore in practice, GP models are often as much about the approximation method as they are about the data. Here, we develop a new class of methods that provides consistent estimation of the combined uncertainty arising from both the finite number of data observed and the finite amount of computation expended. The most common GP approximations map to an instance in this class, such as methods based on the Cholesky factorization, conjugate gradients, and inducing points. For any method in this class, we prove (i) convergence of its posterior mean in the associated RKHS, (ii) decomposability of its combined posterior covariance into mathematical and computational covariances, and (iii) that the combined variance is a tight worst-case bound for the squared error between the method's posterior mean and the latent function. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the consequences of ignoring computational uncertainty and show how implicitly modeling it improves generalization performance on benchmark datasets.},

  abstract = {Audio signals are characterised and perceived based on how their spectral make-up changes with time. Uncovering the behaviour of latent spectral components is at the heart of many real-world applications involving sound, but is a highly ill-posed task given the infi nite number of ways any signal can be decomposed. This motivates the use of prior knowledge and a probabilistic modelling paradigm that can characterise uncertainty. This thesis studies the application of Gaussian processes to audio, which offer a principled non-parametric way to specify probability distributions over functions whilst also encoding prior knowledge. Along the way we consider what prior knowledge we have about sound, the way it behaves, and the way it is perceived, and write down these assumptions in the form of probabilistic models. We show how Bayesian time-frequency analysis can be reformulated as a spectral mixture Gaussian process, and utilise modern day inference methods to carry out joint time-frequency analysis and nonnegative matrix factorisation. Our reformulation results in increased modelling flexibility, allowing more sophisticated prior knowledge to be encoded, which improves performance on a missing data synthesis task. We demonstrate the generality of this paradigm by showing how the joint model can additionally be applied to both denoising and source separation tasks without modi cation. We propose a hybrid statistical-physical model for audio spectrograms based on observations about the way amplitude envelopes decay over time, as well as a nonlinear model based on deep Gaussian processes. We examine the benefi ts of these methods, all of which are generative in the sense that novel signals can be sampled from the underlying models, allowing us to consider the extent to which they encode the important perceptual characteristics of sound.},

This leads to a formulation of control problems in terms of interconnections. Subsequently, we study interconnections of linear time-invariant systems from this vantage point. Let us mention two of the results obtained. The first one states that any polynomial can be achieved as the characteristic polynomial of the interconnection with a given plant, provided the plant is not autonomous. The second result states that any subsystem of a controllable system can be implemented by means of a singular feedback control law. These results yield pole placement and stabilization of controllable plants as a special case. These ideas are finally applied to the stabilization of a nonlinear system around an operating point.},

  abstract = {Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy exploits the magnetic properties of atomic nuclei to discover the structure, reaction state and chemical environment of molecules. We propose a probabilistic generative model and inference procedures for NMR spectroscopy. Specifically, we use a weighted sum of trigonometric functions undergoing exponential decay to model free induction decay (FID) signals. We discuss the challenges in estimating the components of this general model -- amplitudes, phase shifts, frequencies, decay rates, and noise variances -- and offer practical solutions. We compare with conventional Fourier transform spectroscopy for estimating the relative concentrations of chemicals in a mixture, using synthetic and experimentally acquired FID signals. We find the proposed model is particularly robust to low signal to noise ratios (SNR), and overlapping peaks in the Fourier transform of the FID, enabling accurate predictions (e.g., 1\% sensitivity at low SNR) which are not possible with conventional spectroscopy (5\% sensitivity).},

SKI methods produce kernel approximations for fast computations through kernel interpolation. The SKI framework clarifies how the quality of an inducing point approach depends on the number of inducing (aka interpolation) points, interpolation strategy, and GP covariance kernel. SKI also provides a mechanism to create new scalable kernel methods, through choosing different kernel interpolation strategies. Using SKI, with local cubic kernel interpolation, we introduce KISS-GP, which is 1) more scalable than inducing point alternatives, 2) naturally enables Kronecker and Toeplitz algebra for substantial additional gains in scalability, without requiring any grid data, and 3) can be used for fast and expressive kernel learning. KISS-GP costs O(n) time and storage for GP inference. We evaluate KISS-GP for kernel matrix approximation, kernel learning, and natural sound modelling.},

  abstract = {Gaussian processes are the gold standard for many real-world modeling problems, especially in cases where a model's success hinges upon its ability to faithfully represent predictive uncertainty. These problems typically exist as parts of larger frameworks, wherein quantities of interest are ultimately defined by integrating over posterior distributions. These quantities are frequently intractable, motivating the use of Monte Carlo methods. Despite substantial progress in scaling up Gaussian processes to large training sets, methods for accurately generating draws from their posterior distributions still scale cubically in the number of test locations. We identify a decomposition of Gaussian processes that naturally lends itself to scalable sampling by separating out the prior from the data. Building off of this factorization, we propose an easy-to-use and general-purpose approach for fast posterior sampling, which seamlessly pairs with sparse approximations to afford scalability both during training and at test time. In a series of experiments designed to test competing sampling schemes' statistical properties and practical ramifications, we demonstrate how decoupled sample paths accurately represent Gaussian process posteriors at a fraction of the usual cost.},

We propose two criteria to identify critical links on the basis of the topology and the load distribution of the network prior to link failure. They are determined via a link's redundant capacity and a renormalized linear response theory we derive. These criteria outperform critical link prediction based on local measures such as loads. The results not only further our understanding of the physics of supply networks in general. As both criteria are available before any outage from the state of normal operation, they may also help real-time monitoring of grid operation, employing counter-measures and support network planning and design.},

Deep-learning accelerators2--9 aim to perform deep learning energy-efficiently, usually targeting the inference phase and often by exploiting physical substrates beyond conventional electronics. Approaches so far10--22 have been unable to apply the backpropagation algorithm to train unconventional novel hardware in situ. The advantages of backpropagation have made it the~de facto~training method for large-scale neural networks, so this deficiency constitutes a major impediment. Here we introduce a hybrid in situ--in silico algorithm,~called physics-aware training, that applies backpropagation to train controllable physical systems. Just as deep learning realizes computations with deep neural networks made from layers of mathematical functions, our approach allows us to train deep~physical neural networks~made from layers of controllable physical systems, even when the physical layers lack any mathematical isomorphism to conventional artificial neural network layers. To demonstrate the universality of our approach, we train diverse physical neural networks based on optics, mechanics and electronics to experimentally perform audio and image classification tasks. Physics-aware training combines the scalability of backpropagation with the automatic mitigation of imperfections and noise achievable with~in situ~algorithms.~Physical neural networks have the potential to perform machine learning faster and more energy-efficiently than conventional electronic processors and, more broadly, can endow physical systems with automatically designed physical functionalities, for example, for robotics23--26, materials27--29 and smart sensors30--32.},

The interpretation of the signal relies on a model whose order (i.e., the number of resonances) is in general unknown. In this study, the signal is modeled as a sum of Lorentzian lineshapes, and a Bayesian framework is designed to simultaneously remove the baseline distortion, select the number of resonances, and recover the parameters of each lineshape including frequency, damping factor, resonance amplitude, and noise magnitude. The Bayesian problem is solved resorting to a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) sampling scheme. The algorithm is tested on synthetic signals as well as experimental data from a resonant ultrasound spectroscopy experiment aiming to measure elastic properties. The results show that, compared to the well-known linear prediction singular value decomposition method, the RJ-MCMC method achieves a better performance with the advantages of joint model selection, high accuracy estimation, and uncertainty evaluation. We found that when the signal-to-noise-ratio is larger than 20 dB, the average relative error for frequency extraction is smaller than 0.5\%. Such an algorithm enables to estimate the number of resonances and extract tens of resonance parameters from a highly attenuated spectrum, which can significantly facilitate the automated processing of signals exhibiting damped resonances.},

LLaVA-UHD includes three key components: (1) An image modularization strategy that divides native-resolution images into smaller variable-sized slices for efficient and extensible encoding, (2) a compression module that further condenses image tokens from visual encoders, and (3) a spatial schema to organize slice tokens for LLMs. Comprehensive experiments show that LLaVA-UHD outperforms established LMMs trained with 2-3 orders of magnitude more data on 9 benchmarks. Notably, our model built on LLaVA-1.5 336x336 supports 6 times larger (i.e., 672x1088) resolution images using only 94\% inference computation, and achieves 6.4 accuracy improvement on TextVQA.

Considering the success of these two aforementioned research areas, it seems natural to apply PGMs to transfer learning. However, although there are already some excellent PGMs specific to transfer learning in the literature, the potential of PGMs for this problem is still grossly underestimated. This paper aims to boost the development of PGMs for transfer learning by 1) examining the pilot studies on PGMs specific to transfer learning, i.e., analyzing and summarizing the existing mechanisms particularly designed for knowledge transfer; 2) discussing examples of real-world transfer problems where existing PGMs have been successfully applied; and 3) exploring several potential research directions on transfer learning using PGM.},

The formant tracking LP model estimation is composed of three stages: (1) a pre-cleaning spectral amplitude estimation stage where an initial estimate of the LP model of speech for each frame is obtained, (2) a formant classification and estimation stage using probability models of formants and Viterbi-decoders and (3) an inter-frame formant de-noising and smoothing stage where Kalman filters are used to model the formant trajectories and reduce the effect of residue noise on formants. The adverse effects of car and train noise on estimates of formant tracks and LP models are investigated. The evaluation results for the estimation of the formant tracking LP model demonstrate that the proposed combination of the initial noise reduction stage with formant tracking and Kalman smoothing stages, results in a significant reduction in errors and distortions.},

However, despite the abundance of research on the difference in capabilities between GPT series models and fine-tuned models, there has been limited attention given to the evolution of GPT series models' capabilities over time. To conduct a comprehensive analysis of the capabilities of GPT series models, we select six representative models, comprising two GPT-3 series models (i.e., davinci and text-davinci-001) and four GPT-3.5 series models (i.e., code-davinci-002, text-davinci-002, text-davinci-003, and gpt-3.5-turbo). We evaluate their performance on nine natural language understanding (NLU) tasks using 21 datasets. In particular, we compare the performance and robustness of different models for each task under zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal that the overall ability of GPT series models on NLU tasks does not increase gradually as the models evolve, especially with the introduction of the RLHF training strategy. While this strategy enhances the models' ability to generate human-like responses, it also compromises their ability to solve some tasks. Furthermore, our findings indicate that there is still room for improvement in areas such as model robustness.},

The surprising emergent capabilities of MLLM, such as writing stories based on images and OCR-free math reasoning, are rare in traditional methods, suggesting a potential path to artificial general intelligence. In this paper, we aim to trace and summarize the recent progress of MLLM. First of all, we present the formulation of MLLM and delineate its related concepts. Then, we discuss the key techniques and applications, including Multimodal Instruction Tuning (M-IT), Multimodal In-Context Learning (M-ICL), Multimodal Chain of Thought (M-CoT), and LLM-Aided Visual Reasoning (LAVR). Finally, we discuss existing challenges and point out promising research directions. In light of the fact that the era of MLLM has only just begun, we will keep updating this survey and hope it can inspire more research.

These models are nonparametric Bayesian extensions of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) based on the source-filter paradigm, and in them an amplitude or power spectrogram is decomposed as the product of two kinds of spectral atoms (sources and filters) and time-varying gains of source-filter pairs. In this study we model musical instruments as autoregressive systems that combine two types of sources---periodic signals (comb-shaped densities) and white noise (flat density)---with all-pole filters representing resonance characteristics. One of the main problems with such composite autoregressive models (CARMs) is that the numbers of sources and filters should be given in advance. To solve this problem, we propose nonparametric Bayesian models based on gamma processes and efficient variational and multiplicative learning algorithms. These infinite CARMs (iCARMs) can discover appropriate numbers of sources and filters in a data-driven manner. We report the experimental results of multipitch analysis on the MAPS piano database.},

A main problem of classical LP is that the peaks of the estimated envelope are highly biased toward the harmonic partials of a speech spectrum. To solve this problem, we propose a nonparametric Bayesian model called infinite kernel linear prediction (IKLP) based on a Gaussian process with multiple kernel learning. Our model can represent the periodicity of a speech signal by using a weighted sum of infinitely many periodic kernels that correspond to different F0s. We put a gamma process prior on the positive weights of those kernels and perform sparse learning to determine a predominant kernel indicating the F0 at the same time of spectral envelope estimation. The experimental results showed that our model can estimate spectral envelopes and F0s of speech and singing signals while identifying pitched segments.},

Fig. 1 (a) shows such a curve, the random errors having been determined by the throws of dice. If the errors are increased in magnitude, as in fig. 1 (b), the graph becomes more irregular, the suggestion of periodicity more obscure, and we have only sufficiently to increase the ``errors'' to mask completely any appearance of periodicity. But, however large the errors, periodogram analysis is applicable to such a curve, and, given a sufficient number of periods, should yield a close approximation to the period and amplitude of the underlying harmonic function. When periodogram analysis is applied to data respecting any physical phenomenon in the expectation of eliciting one or more true periodicities, there is usually, as it seems to me, a tendency to start from the initial hypothesis that the periodicity or periodicities are masked solely by such more or less random superposed fluctuations--- fluctuations which do not in any way disturb the steady course of the underlying periodic function or functions. It is true that the periodogram itself will indicate the truth or otherwise of the hypothesis made, but there seems no reason for assuming it to be the hypothesis most likely a priori.},

In the present paper, a Viterbi-type training algorithm based on the maximum likelihood criterion is also derived. The performance of the trajectory HMM was evaluated both in speech recognition and synthesis. In a speaker-dependent continuous speech recognition experiment, the trajectory HMM achieved an error reduction over the corresponding standard HMM.

We find the method to be efficient, scaling easily to networks with a million or more nodes and we test it on a range of networks, including real-world examples as well as computer-generated benchmarks, for which it successfully identifies known core-periphery structure with low error rate. We also demonstrate that the method is immune from the detectability transition observed in the related community detection problem, which prevents the detection of community structure when that structure is too weak. There is no such transition for core-periphery structure, which is detectable, albeit with some statistical error, no matter how weak it is.},

  abstract = {Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings correction steps. Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To this end, we propose Differentiable AIS (DAIS), a variant of AIS which ensures differentiability by abandoning the Metropolis-Hastings corrections. As a further advantage, DAIS allows for mini-batch gradients. We provide a detailed convergence analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by explicitly accounting for the sampler not having reached equilibrium. Using this analysis, we prove that DAIS is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a sublinear convergence rate. Furthermore, motivated by the problem of learning from large-scale datasets, we study a stochastic variant of DAIS that uses mini-batch gradients. Surprisingly, stochastic DAIS can be arbitrarily bad due to a fundamental incompatibility between the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the accumulated stochastic error. This is in stark contrast with other settings such as gradient-based optimization and Langevin dynamics, where the effect of gradient noise can be washed out by taking smaller steps. This indicates that annealing-based marginal likelihood estimation with stochastic gradients may require new ideas.},

Recent advancements in LLMs, such as MiniGPT-4, LLaVA, and X-LLM, further enlarge their abilities by incorporating multi-modal inputs, including image, video, and speech. Despite their effectiveness at generating precise and detailed language understanding of the given modality signal, these LLMs give up the ability to ground specific parts of inputs, thus only constructing a coarse-grained mapping. However, explicit and informative correspondence between text and other modalities will not only improve the user experience but also help to expand the application scenario of multi-modal LLMs. Therefore, we propose BuboGPT, a multi-modal LLM with visual grounding that can perform cross-modal interaction between vision, audio and language, providing fine-grained understanding of visual objects and other given modalities. As a result, BuboGPT is able to point out the specific location of an object in the image, when it is generating response or description for that object. Our contributions are two-fold: 1) An off-the-shelf visual grounding module based on SAM that extracts entities in a sentence and find corresponding masks in the image. 2) A two-stage training scheme and instruction dataset to endow joint text-image-audio understanding. Our experiments show that BuboGPT achieves impressive multi-modality understanding and visual grounding abilities during the interaction with human. It performs consistently well when provided by arbitrary modality combinations (either aligned or unaligned). Our code, model and dataset are available at https://bubo-gpt.github.io .},

Since then and to this date, the prevailing view has been that the particle motion out of nodal lines is random, implying uncontrollability. But how random really is the out-of-nodal-lines motion on a Chladni plate? Here we show that the motion is sufficiently regular to be statistically modelled, predicted and controlled. By playing carefully selected musical notes, we can control the position of multiple objects simultaneously and independently using a single acoustic actuator.

Our findings reveal that MiniGPT-4 possesses many capabilities similar to those exhibited by GPT-4 like detailed image description generation and website creation from hand-written drafts. Furthermore, we also observe other emerging capabilities in MiniGPT-4, including writing stories and poems inspired by given images, providing solutions to problems shown in images, teaching users how to cook based on food photos, etc. In our experiment, we found that only performing the pretraining on raw image-text pairs could produce unnatural language outputs that lack coherency including repetition and fragmented sentences. To address this problem, we curate a high-quality, well-aligned dataset in the second stage to finetune our model using a conversational template. This step proved crucial for augmenting the model's generation reliability and overall usability. Notably, our model is highly computationally efficient, as we only train a projection layer utilizing approximately 5 million aligned image-text pairs. Our code, pre-trained model, and collected dataset are available at https://minigpt-4.github.io/.},

  abstract = {Both Minsky's "society of mind" and Schmidhuber's "learning to think" inspire diverse societies of large multimodal neural networks (NNs) that solve problems by interviewing each other in a "mindstorm." Recent implementations of NN-based societies of minds consist of large language models (LLMs) and other NN-based experts communicating through a natural language interface. In doing so, they overcome the limitations of single LLMs, improving multimodal zero-shot reasoning. In these natural language-based societies of mind (NLSOMs), new agents -- all communicating through the same universal symbolic language -- are easily added in a modular fashion. To demonstrate the power of NLSOMs, we assemble and experiment with several of them (having up to 129 members), leveraging mindstorms in them to solve some practical AI tasks: visual question answering, image captioning, text-to-image synthesis, 3D generation, egocentric retrieval, embodied AI, and general language-based task solving. We view this as a starting point towards much larger NLSOMs with billions of agents-some of which may be humans. And with this emergence of great societies of heterogeneous minds, many new research questions have suddenly become paramount to the future of artificial intelligence. What should be the social structure of an NLSOM? What would be the (dis)advantages of having a monarchical rather than a democratic structure? How can principles of NN economies be used to maximize the total reward of a reinforcement learning NLSOM? In this work, we identify, discuss, and try to answer some of these questions.},

  abstract = {Abstract For many complex networks present in nature only a single instance, usually of large size, is available. Any measurement made on this single instance cannot be repeated on different realizations. In order to detect significant patterns in a real-world network it is therefore crucial to compare the measured results with a null model counterpart. Here we focus on dense and weighted networks, proposing a suitable null model and studying the behaviour of the degree correlations as measured by the rich-club coefficient. Our method solves an existing problem with the randomization of dense unweighted graphs, and at the same time represents a generalization of the rich-club coefficient to weighted networks which is complementary to other recently proposed ones.},

These networks build a hierarchy of progressively more complex distributed representations of the sensory data by fitting a hierarchical generative model. In this article we discuss the theoretical foundations of this approach and we review key issues related to training, testing and analysis of deep networks for modeling language and cognitive processing. The classic letter and word perception problem of McClelland and Rumelhart (1981) is used as a tutorial example to illustrate how structured and abstract representations may emerge from deep generative learning. We argue that the focus on deep architectures and generative (rather than discriminative) learning represents a crucial step forward for the connectionist modeling enterprise, because it offers a more plausible model of cortical learning as well as a way to bridge the gap between emergentist connectionist models and structured Bayesian models of cognition.},
