- [ ] Mercer
    - [x] Needs no awareness of ndim
    - [x] +, * : always stack/kathri rao
    - [ ] Transforms always possible
    - [ ] Differentiation possible
    - [x] Scaling via weights
    - [ ] Subspace is an ordinary Transform

- [ ] Hilbert
    - [x] Dont need axis info, only ndim
    - [x] ndim via post init: need to specify if M, L scalar or assume 1. Make len M and len L ndim info.
    - [ ] Can always assume same domain: +, *: sum and convolution spectral densities. M = max(M1, M2), can differ!
    - [ ] Arbitrary transform: jax.Bijector and logdet. Rewrite Cholesky in that way. Spectral density is known via inverse and logdet of Bijectors!
    - [ ] Go hard on numerical convolution, massive gains: O(1) vs O(M1*M2)!

- [ ] Subspace(Hilbert, transforms.Subspace)
    - [ ] This has axes prop built in
    - [ ] Define sum and mul here: then we know everything.
        - [ ] If other is another Hilbert Subspace, check if identical and if so use Hilbert for +,* above
        - [ ] Else fallback to Mercer
    - [ ] Convolution possibly still salvageable even for different subspaces: absent axes just produce deltas
